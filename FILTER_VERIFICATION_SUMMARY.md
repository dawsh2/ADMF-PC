# Filter Verification Summary for Keltner Bands Optimization

## Key Finding: Filters ARE Working Correctly ✅

### Signal Generation Results
- **Workspace**: `workspaces/signal_generation_310b2aeb`
- **Total strategies tested**: 45 (out of 122 configured)
- **Total bars processed**: 81,787 (train split: 80% of data)
- **Total signal changes stored**: 360,629

### Filter Effectiveness

#### 1. Entry Reduction (Primary Metric)
Filters successfully reduced entry signals while maintaining balanced exits:

- **Baseline (no filter)**: 6,292 - 8,965 entries
- **Most aggressive filter**: 44 entries (99.5% reduction!)
- **Typical filtered strategies**: 1,000 - 4,000 entries (50-85% reduction)

#### 2. Signal Rate Consistency
All strategies maintain ~50% signal rate because:
- Filters use pattern: `signal == 0 or <condition>`
- This allows ALL exits (signal → 0 transitions)
- Only entries (0 → signal transitions) are filtered
- Result: Fewer trades but similar time in position

#### 3. Specific Examples

**Baseline Strategy (0)**:
- Long entries: 4,006
- Short entries: 4,413
- Total: 8,419 entries

**RSI Filtered Strategy (30)**:
- Long entries: 2,169 (46% reduction)
- Short entries: 2,471 (44% reduction)
- Total: 4,640 entries (45% reduction)

**Heavily Filtered Strategy (40)**:
- Long entries: 615 (85% reduction)
- Short entries: 624 (86% reduction)
- Total: 1,239 entries (85% reduction)

### Distribution of Filter Effectiveness

| Entry Count Range | # Strategies | Description |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| < 2,000          | 9            | Very heavily filtered |
| 2,000 - 3,000    | 10           | Heavily filtered |
| 3,000 - 4,600    | 10           | Moderately filtered |
| 4,600 - 6,100    | 8            | Lightly filtered |
| > 6,100          | 8            | Baseline/minimal filtering |

### Technical Verification

1. **Parquet files generated**: ✅ All 45 strategies have signal files
2. **Signal compression working**: ✅ Sparse storage reduced 3.68M signals to 360K changes
3. **Filter logic correct**: ✅ Using `signal == 0 or ...` pattern allows exits
4. **Entry/exit balance**: ✅ Exits match entries (small differences at boundaries)

### Next Steps

1. Run performance analysis on these signals to find strategies with:
   - Edge ≥ 1 bps after costs
   - 2-3+ trades per day
   
2. Test on 5-minute timeframe (config ready: `optimize_keltner_5m.yaml`)

3. Implement stop losses (previous analysis showed 0.3% stop improved edge)
