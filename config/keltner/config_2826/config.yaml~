name: keltner_2826_production
data: SPY_5m

strategy:
  - keltner_bands:
      # Exact parameters that produce 2826 signals (Strategy 3)
      period: [30]      # This specific combination produces 2826 signals
      multiplier: [1.0] # with the volatility filter
      
      # The volatility filter that creates the 2826-signal pattern
      # MUST be a list of filter dictionaries (not a string)
      filter:
        - {volatility_above: {threshold: 0.8}}
      
      # Alternative: If you want to test slight variations
      # period: [15, 20, 25]
      # multiplier: [1.5, 2.0, 2.5]
      # filter: {volatility_above: {threshold: [1.0, 1.1, 1.2]}}

# Notes on implementation:
# 1. This strategy has 18.8% signal reduction from baseline (3481 -> 2826)
# 2. Volatility filter: Trades when ATR(14)/ATR(50) > 0.8 (was 1.1 in training)
# 3. All 11 parameter combinations that produce 2826 signals are equivalent
# 4. Strategy IDs with 2826 signals: [3, 28, 53, 78, 103, 128, 153, 178, 203, 228, 253]
# 5. Expected annual return: ~2.6% net (9.7% gross before costs)
