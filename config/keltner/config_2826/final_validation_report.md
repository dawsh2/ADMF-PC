## Ready for Test Data

The strategy has been successfully validated on the training data with identical results to the original analysis. You can now run it on test data with confidence that:

1. The implementation is correct
2. Parameters are properly configured
3. Expected performance metrics are reproducible

### Test Data Expectations
- Should see similar 5-7 trades/day frequency
- Win rate should be in 65-75% range
- Returns may vary but volatility filter should help in volatile markets
- Monitor long vs short performance for potential long-only switch

### Risk Management Reminders
- Current edge is 0.18 bps net (small but consistent)
- Requires excellent execution (<0.5 bps costs)
- Consider 20 bps stop loss (showed 30% improvement in earlier analysis)
- Maximum daily loss limit: 2% recommended
