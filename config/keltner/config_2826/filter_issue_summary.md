# Filter Not Being Applied - Critical Issue

## The Problem
Changing the volatility filter threshold from 1.1 to 0.8 produces EXACTLY the same 726 signals. This is impossible if the filter was working.

## Evidence
1. **Training data**: 2,826 signals with 1.1 threshold
2. **Test data with 1.1**: 726 signals  
3. **Test data with 0.8**: 726 signals (should be more!)
4. **No enhanced_metadata.json** to show filter info

## Conclusion
The volatility filter is NOT being applied during execution. The 726 signals are the raw Keltner band crossings without any filtering.

## Possible Causes
1. **Config syntax issue**: The filter format might not be correct
2. **Implementation gap**: The Keltner strategy might not support filters
3. **Test data reference**: The test run might be using different config

## Why Test Failed
Without the volatility filter, you're getting ALL Keltner signals including:
- Low volatility periods (poor performance)
- Choppy markets (false signals)
- Mean reversion without sufficient volatility

The filter was crucial for the 0.68 bps performance - without it, you get -1.56 bps.

## Next Steps
1. Verify the filter syntax matches what the system expects
2. Check if filters are supported in the current implementation
3. Consider running test data through the exact same pipeline as training
4. The test data may need the full parameter sweep to find what works

## Key Insight
The 2,826 â†’ 726 reduction (74%) shows the test period has far fewer Keltner band crosses, indicating a fundamentally different market regime (likely lower volatility, tighter ranges).
