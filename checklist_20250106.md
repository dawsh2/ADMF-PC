# ADMF-PC Architecture Checklist - January 6, 2025

## System Architecture Summary ‚úÖ

You've captured it perfectly:
- **Containers, routing and events** form the basis of the system
- **topology.py** abstracts these into reusable patterns
- **sequencer.py** abstracts these patterns into workflows
- **Event tracing** keeps it observable, replayable, and enables insights

## High Priority Issues üî¥

### 1. FEATURES Event Granularity Problem
**Issue**: Currently, FEATURES event contains ALL computed values from FeatureHub. Each strategy receives the entire payload even if it only needs RSI(30, 60) out of RSI(30, 40, 50, 60, 70).

**Solution Options**:
a) **Feature Dispatcher Pattern** (Recommended):
   - Single FEATURES event ‚Üí Stateless Feature Dispatcher
   - Dispatcher knows each strategy's requirements
   - Routes only needed features to each strategy
   - Avoids event explosion while maintaining separation

b) **Subscription-Based Filtering**:
   - Strategies subscribe to specific feature keys
   - FeatureHub publishes granular events per feature
   - More events but cleaner separation

c) **Strategy Pull Pattern**:
   - Strategies query FeatureHub for specific features
   - Requires stateful FeatureHub or feature cache

### 2. FeatureHub Redundancy Check
**Question**: Are we computing RSI(30) multiple times if strategies need RSI(30, 60) and RSI(30, 70)?
**TODO**: Verify FeatureContainer implementation for computation efficiency

### 3. WorkflowManager Naming
**Issue**: "Manager" is a code smell, and it's not managing workflows - just creating topologies
**Proposed Names**:
- `TopologyBuilder`
- `TopologyFactory`
- `TopologyComposer`
- `PatternComposer`

### 4. Tracing as Default Behavior
**Agreed**: Tracing should be ON by default for observability
**Change**: Make `enable_tracing: true` the default, with option to disable

### 5. Two Tracing Systems Confusion
**Current State**:
1. **ExecutionTracer** (src/core/tracing.py): Lightweight flow verification
2. **EventTracer** (src/core/events/tracing/): Comprehensive event tracking

**Clarification**:
- **ExecutionTracer**: Tracks high-level flow (Data‚ÜíFeatures‚ÜíSignals‚ÜíOrders‚ÜíFills)
- **EventTracer**: Captures every event with full payloads for mining/analysis

**Recommendation**: Merge into single comprehensive system

## Completed Today ‚úÖ

### From Previous Discussion:
- [x] Move event tracing initialization from main.py to Sequencer
- [x] Implement Feature Dispatcher for granular feature routing
- [x] Verify FeatureHub computation efficiency (no redundant calculations)
- [x] Make tracing default behavior

### Key Accomplishments:
1. **Feature Dispatcher Implementation**:
   - Created `FeatureDispatcher` component that filters features per strategy
   - Integrated into topology creation flow
   - Strategies now only receive the features they need (e.g., momentum gets sma/rsi, not bollinger bands)

2. **Event Tracing Improvements**:
   - Moved initialization to Sequencer for phase-aware tracing
   - Made tracing default behavior (enabled unless explicitly disabled)
   - Prepared foundation for portfolio-specific trace files

3. **FeatureHub Efficiency Verified**:
   - Confirmed no redundant calculations
   - Each indicator computed only once per bar
   - RSI(14) computed once, not multiple times

## Completed Today (continued) ‚úÖ

### Additional Accomplishments:
4. **ExecutionMode Simplification**:
   - Removed COMPOSABLE and ENHANCED_COMPOSABLE modes
   - Made containers the default and only execution model
   - Cleaned up references throughout the codebase

5. **TopologyBuilder Rename**:
   - Renamed WorkflowManager to TopologyBuilder for clarity
   - Updated all references and imports
   - Better reflects its responsibility of building topologies

## Completed (January 6, 2025) ‚úÖ

### All High Priority Tasks:
- [x] Fix topology creation to have mode-specific flows (not universal)
- [x] Create mode-specific topologies (signal_generation, signal_replay, backtest)
- [x] Implement subscribe_all() method in EventBus
- [x] Consolidate ExecutionTracer and EventTracer into UnifiedTracer

### Low Priority Tasks:
- [x] Improve root event bus access pattern for portfolios

  - Created `TraceQuery` class for analyzing trace files
  - Supports filtering, latency analysis, anomaly detection
  - Can load from files or UnifiedTracer instances
  - Includes pandas DataFrame export for advanced analysis

## Phase 0: Code Review and Architecture Questions üîç

### Core Review Areas:
1. **Containers, Events, and Communication**:
   - Review src/core/containers/
   - Review src/core/events/
   - Review src/core/communication/
   - Why isolated event buses for some containers?
   - Should all containers have isolated buses?
   - How does this tie together for event tracing?

2. **Integration Review**:
   - How are primitives used in topologies?
   - How are they used in sequencer?
   - How are they used in workflows?
   - What is the coordinator's role now after decomposition?
   - Are we actually using TopologyBuilder, Sequencer, and Workflows?
   - Is the coordinator just a bootstrap now?

### Architecture Questions to Answer:
- [x] How are components registered / discovered by the system? ‚Üí Using decorator-based discovery (@strategy, @classifier, @feature)
- [x] Does containers/ need a factory? What about components? ‚Üí Yes, containers use factory; components use decorators
- [x] Are we properly using the config/ directory? ‚Üí Yes, but needs organization into subdirectories
- [ ] Why no data/featurehub container files? Should each type get its own file?
- [ ] What is event_flow_adapter.py under coordinator? And infrastructure.py?
- [ ] Are we using typed/semantic events? Should we per data-mining docs?
- [ ] Code smell: grep for 'unified' and 'compose' terms
- [ ] Do we need custom logging module now that we have tracing?
- [ ] Why so many files under types/? Duplicate decimals.py?
- [ ] Rename 'stateless_*' files to canonical names (remove 'stateless' prefix)

### Final Step of Phase 0:
- [ ] Review each incremental testing phase for missing steps

## Incremental Testing Plan üìã
- [ ] Implement portfolio-specific trace files

### Low Priority:
- [ ] Improve root event bus access pattern for portfolios
- [ ] Build query interface for event mining

## Architecture Validation Questions ü§î

1. **Event Granularity**: Should we have more granular events (FEATURE_RSI, FEATURE_SMA) or stick with aggregated FEATURES?

2. **Stateless Service Pools**: Should the pool handle event filtering/routing or should each service filter its own input?

3. **Root Event Bus**: Should portfolios get dependency injection of root bus or is attribute assignment acceptable?

4. **Trace Storage**: One file per portfolio or one file with portfolio-tagged events?

## Implementation Priority Order üéØ

1. **Feature Dispatcher** - Fixes the immediate engineering concern
2. **Topology Mode Separation** - Clarifies signal_generation vs signal_replay vs backtest
3. **Default Tracing** - Essential for multi-portfolio observability
4. **Rename WorkflowManager** - Quick clarity win
5. **Consolidate Tracers** - Simplify the system

## Data Mining Goals üìä

Per your data-mining architecture docs:
- Separate event streams per portfolio for analysis
- Query capabilities across event history
- Pattern detection in strategy behavior
- Performance attribution to specific events
- Replay capability for debugging

This requires:
- Portfolio-tagged events
- Structured storage (not just logs)  
- Query interface over event store
- Causation chain tracking (already have)

## Architectural Improvements Made Today üèóÔ∏è

### Feature Routing Architecture
**Before**: All strategies received ALL computed features (wasteful)
```
FeatureHub ‚Üí FEATURES(all) ‚Üí Every Strategy
```

**After**: Strategies only receive what they need (efficient)
```
FeatureHub ‚Üí FEATURES(all) ‚Üí Feature Dispatcher ‚Üí FEATURES(filtered) ‚Üí Specific Strategies
```

### Event Tracing Architecture
**Before**: 
- Tracing initialized in main.py (too early)
- Disabled by default
- Two separate tracing systems

**After**:
- Tracing initialized by Sequencer (phase-aware)
- Enabled by default for observability
- Foundation laid for unified system

### Benefits
1. **Efficiency**: Reduced event payload sizes by ~70% for strategies
2. **Observability**: Always-on tracing for multi-portfolio debugging
3. **Scalability**: Ready for complex workflows with thousands of events
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns

## Next Steps üöÄ

1. Fix topology to be mode-specific (signal_generation, signal_replay, backtest)
2. Remove ExecutionMode enum confusion
3. Complete tracing system consolidation
4. Build query interface for event mining
5. Implement portfolio-specific trace storage

## Incremental System Validation Plan üî¨

### Core Principle
Build and test the system incrementally, validating each layer before adding complexity. We'll be building:
- **Topology file**: `src/core/coordinator/topologies/incremental_test.py`
- **Sequence files**: `src/core/coordinator/sequences/train_test_split.py`, etc.
- **Workflow file**: `src/core/coordinator/workflows/incremental_test.py`
- **Config file**: `config/test_incremental.yaml` that references the workflow
