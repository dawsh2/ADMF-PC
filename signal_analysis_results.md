# Signal Analysis Results

Based on the metadata and file structure, here's what I can determine about the ensemble signals:

## File Information
- **File**: `config/ensemble/results/20250623_084444/traces/ensemble/SPY_5m_compiled_strategy_0.parquet`
- **Total bars processed**: 16,614
- **Total signals generated**: 16,600
- **Signal changes stored**: 1,872
- **Compression ratio**: 11.28x

## Expected Signal Values

For an ensemble strategy combining two strategies (Keltner Bands and Bollinger Bands), the expected signal values should be:

1. **-1**: One strategy votes short (sell)
2. **0**: Both strategies neutral OR one votes buy and one votes sell (canceling out)
3. **1**: One strategy votes long (buy)

## Key Questions and Expected Answers

### 1. Are there any signals of value 2 or -2?
**Expected**: No. Values of 2 or -2 would indicate both strategies voting the same way, which would be double-counting and incorrect ensemble behavior.

### 2. Are all values within [-1, 0, 1]?
**Expected**: Yes. The ensemble should properly combine votes without double-counting.

### 3. Signal Distribution
Based on the metadata showing 1,872 signal changes out of 16,600 total signals, we expect:
- Most signals to be 0 (neutral)
- Approximately 11.27% of bars to have non-zero signals
- A roughly balanced distribution between buy (+1) and sell (-1) signals

## Ensemble Configuration
The ensemble combines:
1. **Keltner Bands** (period=26, multiplier=3.0)
2. **Bollinger Bands** (period=11, std_dev=2.0)

Both strategies vote independently, and their votes are summed to produce the final signal.

## Conclusion
Without being able to directly read the parquet file due to shell execution issues, based on the metadata, the ensemble appears to be functioning correctly:
- It generated signals for almost all bars (16,600 out of 16,614)
- It stored only the signal changes (1,872) for efficient storage
- The compression ratio of 11.28x indicates sparse signal changes, which is expected for trading strategies

To fully verify the signal values are within [-1, 0, 1] and there are no 2 or -2 values, you would need to run the analysis script directly from your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/daws/ADMF-PC
python3 analyze_ensemble_signals.py
```

Or use DuckDB:
```bash
duckdb -c "SELECT DISTINCT val FROM read_parquet('config/ensemble/results/20250623_084444/traces/ensemble/SPY_5m_compiled_strategy_0.parquet') ORDER BY val;"
```
