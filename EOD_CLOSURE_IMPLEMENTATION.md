# EOD Closure Implementation Summary

## Problem
- Extended hours data (8 AM to 11:55 PM) was causing overnight positions
- 75 out of 211 days had overnight positions (35.5%)
- Signals were being generated after 3:50 PM market hours

## Solution Approach
We implemented EOD closure using a two-pronged approach:

1. **Threshold-based prevention**: Using HHMM format (e.g., 1550 for 3:50 PM) to prevent new signals
2. **Forced closure**: Active strategy monitoring that injects flat signals at EOD
3. **Automatic activation**: When `--close-eod` flag is used

## Updated Implementation (Uses 'threshold' instead of deprecated 'filter')

## Implementation Details

### 1. Added time variables to filter context
In `src/strategy/components/config_filter.py`:
```python
context['hour'] = ts.hour
context['minute'] = ts.minute  
context['time'] = ts.hour * 100 + ts.minute  # HHMM format
```

### 2. Created EOD filter helper
In `src/strategy/components/eod_timeframe_helper.py`:
```python
def create_eod_filter_for_timeframe(timeframe_minutes: int, existing_filter: str = None) -> str:
    exit_time = 1550  # Force exit at 3:50 PM
    eod_filter = f"time < {exit_time}"
    
    if existing_filter:
        return f"({existing_filter}) and ({eod_filter})"
    else:
        return eod_filter
```

### 3. Two-level EOD closure implementation
In `src/core/coordinator/compiler.py`:
- Applies EOD threshold expression when `close_eod` is enabled
- Threshold prevents new signals after 3:50 PM: `time < 1550`
- Combines with existing thresholds using AND logic

In `src/strategy/state.py`:
- Active monitoring with `_check_and_force_eod_closure` method
- Forces flat signals for any non-zero positions at EOD
- Ensures all positions are closed even if threshold didn't catch them

## Key Advantages
1. **Clean separation**: Execution logic (EOD) separate from strategy logic
2. **Timeframe agnostic**: Works across all timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, etc.)
3. **Extended hours compatible**: Handles data up to 11:55 PM correctly
4. **Configurable**: Can be enabled/disabled with `--close-eod` flag

## Usage
```bash
python main.py --config config.yaml --signal-generation --close-eod
```

## Next Steps
- Verify EOD closure is working (no signals after 3:50 PM)
- Analyze performance with proper EOD closure
- Implement stop-loss analysis as planned
