# Keltner Strategies - Final Realistic Analysis with Full OHLC Data

## Executive Summary

Using full OHLC data to properly test stop losses reveals:
1. The previous "high-performance" results were based on sparse signal data
2. Realistic performance is 0.12-0.68 bps/trade (not 2.70+ bps)
3. Stop losses provide modest improvements (20-60%)
4. Ultra-tight stops (1-2 bps) are counterproductive

## Strategy Performance Comparison

### Top Performing Strategies (Baseline, No Stops)

| Strategy | Trades | RPT (bps) | Win Rate | Daily Trades |
|----------|--------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Strategy 20 | 23 | 3.74 | 56.5% | 0.09 |
| Strategy 21 | 151 | 0.76 | 59.6% | 0.59 |
| Strategy 3 | 1,430 | 0.36 | 50.4% | 5.61 |
| Strategy 2 | 1,644 | 0.12 | 50.2% | 6.45 |
| Strategy 4 | 1,174 | 0.45 | 53.0% | 4.60 |

### With Optimal 20 bps Stop Loss

| Strategy | Baseline | With Stop | Improvement | Stop Rate |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Strategy 20 | 3.74 | 3.74 | 0% | 0% |
| Strategy 3 | 0.36 | 0.59 | +64% | 2.5% |
| Strategy 2 | 0.12 | 0.33 | +175% | 3.0% |
| Strategy 4 | 0.45 | 0.59 | +31% | 2.4% |

## Key Findings

### 1. Strategy 20 is an Outlier
- Only 23 trades (0.09/day) - not viable for regular trading
- High per-trade return but too infrequent
- No trades hit 20 bps stop (trades are large moves)

### 2. Strategy 4 is the Best Practical Choice
- **4.6 trades/day** - meets frequency requirement
- **0.45 bps/trade** baseline
- **0.59 bps/trade** with 20 bps stop (+31%)
- 53% win rate is realistic

### 3. Stop Loss Reality Check (Strategy 4)
| Stop Loss | RPT (bps) | Stop Rate | Winners Stopped |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 bps | 0.45 | 80.5% | 98.7% |
| 2 bps | 0.49 | 66.1% | 97.2% |
| 5 bps | 0.51 | 35.9% | 84.1% |
| 10 bps | 0.58 | 13.2% | 59.4% |
| 20 bps | 0.59 | 2.4% | 25.0% |

**Critical insight**: Ultra-tight stops (1-2 bps) stop out mostly winners!

## Realistic Performance Projections

### Strategy 4 with 20 bps Stop
- **Per trade**: 0.59 bps
- **Daily**: 2.71 bps (4.6 trades × 0.59 bps)
- **Annual**: ~6.8% (252 days × 2.71 bps)
- **Sharpe**: ~1.0-1.5 (estimated)

### Execution Costs Impact
Current analysis uses 0.5 bps execution cost. Real costs may vary:
- Market orders: 1-2 bps
- Limit orders: 0.1-0.5 bps
- Adjust expectations accordingly

## Updated Recommendations

### 1. Focus on Strategy 4
- Best balance of frequency and edge
- 4.6 trades/day meets requirements
- Proven improvement with stops

### 2. Implement 10-20 bps Stops
- 10 bps: Better for high volatility
- 20 bps: Better for normal conditions
- Avoid < 5 bps stops

### 3. Realistic Expectations
- Target: 0.5-0.6 bps per trade
- Annual return: 5-7%
- Not the 94% previously suggested!

### 4. Paper Trade First
- Verify stop behavior matches backtest
- Monitor actual execution costs
- Track slippage on stops

## Why the Discrepancy?

The previous analysis showing 2.70+ bps/trade likely:
1. Used sparse signal data only
2. Couldn't see intrabar price movements
3. Incorrectly modeled stop losses
4. May have had different execution assumptions

## Conclusion

The Keltner strategies remain profitable but with realistic expectations:
- **0.45-0.59 bps/trade** (not 2.70+ bps)
- **5-7% annual return** (not 94%)
- **Stop losses help** but aren't magic
- **Ultra-tight stops hurt** performance

This is still a viable strategy but requires proper expectations and risk management.
