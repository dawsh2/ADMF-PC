### Key Insights

1. **Tighter bands perform better**: Multipliers 0.55-0.70 achieve the best edge
2. **All strategies profitable**: 100% of tested strategies show positive edge after costs
3. **Consistent win rates**: Most strategies achieve 73-77% win rate
4. **Good frequency**: 500-800 trades/year provides good statistical significance

## Comparison: 1m vs 5m Timeframe

| Metric | 1-Minute | 5-Minute | Improvement |
|--------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Best Edge | 0.14 bps | 0.93 bps | **6.6x better** |
| Avg Edge | 0.05 bps | 0.48 bps | **9.6x better** |
| Best Annual Return | 4.50% | 6.38% | **42% higher** |
| Strategies >0.5 bps | 0 | 10 | **Significant** |

## Recommendations

### 1. Optimal Base Configuration
```yaml
- type: keltner_bands
  params:
    period: 50
    multiplier: 0.60
  timeframe: "5m"
```

### 2. Consider Adding Filters
While the base strategy is close to 1 bps, adding selective filters could push it over:
- **VWAP distance filter**: Trade when price stretched from VWAP
- **Volume confirmation**: Ensure adequate liquidity
- **Volatility filter**: Trade in normal volatility regimes

### 3. Alternative Settings
For different risk/frequency preferences:
- **Higher frequency**: Use multiplier 0.50 (865 trades/year, 0.50 bps)
- **Higher edge**: Use multiplier 0.60 (682 trades/year, 0.93 bps)
- **Balanced**: Use multiplier 0.55 (775 trades/year, 0.81 bps)

## Next Steps

1. **Test with filters**: Run the comprehensive config that includes VWAP, trend, and volatility filters
2. **Implement stop losses**: Previous analysis showed 3x improvement with 0.3% stops
3. **Forward test**: Validate on out-of-sample data (remaining 20%)
4. **Position sizing**: With 76.7% win rate, Kelly criterion suggests ~20% allocation

## Conclusion

The 5-minute Keltner Bands strategy shows promising results that are very close to the 1 bps target. With minor enhancements (filters, stops), it could easily exceed the threshold while maintaining good trade frequency.
