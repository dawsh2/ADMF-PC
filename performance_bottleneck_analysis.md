# Signal Generation Performance Bottleneck Analysis

## Executive Summary

The system is processing 963 strategies with centralized features but experiencing slow performance. Based on profiling, the main bottlenecks are:

1. **Feature computation overhead**: ~1.1ms per bar for feature updates
2. **Component readiness checking**: Checking all 1000 strategies every bar
3. **Strategy execution accumulation**: While individual strategies are fast (~0.01-0.02ms), 1000 adds up

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Feature Computation (FeatureHub)

**Current Performance:**
- Initial feature computation: ~2.14ms for 11 features
- Incremental update per bar: ~1.12ms (mean), 1.31ms (max)
- Feature retrieval (get_features): <0.001ms

**Breakdown by Feature Type:**
- SMA features: 0.04-0.24ms (faster for longer periods)
- RSI: ~0.58ms 
- ATR: ~0.83ms (most expensive)
- Bollinger Bands: ~0.15ms
- Volume/High/Low: ~0.04-0.05ms

**Key Issue:** The FeatureHub recomputes ALL features on every bar update, even though most features only need the latest value appended.

### 2. ComponentState Overhead

**Main bottleneck:** The `_execute_components_individually` method checks readiness for all 1000 strategies on every bar:

```python
for component_id, component_info in components_snapshot:
    if self._is_component_ready(component_id, component_info, features, current_bars):
        # Add to ready list
```

**Impact:**
- Each readiness check: ~10-50μs
- For 1000 strategies: ~10-50ms just for checking readiness
- This happens EVERY bar, even after warmup when all strategies are ready

### 3. Strategy Execution

**Individual strategy performance is good:**
- MA Crossover: ~0.01ms per call
- RSI Strategy: ~0.01ms per call
- Mean Reversion: ~0.02ms per call
- Breakout: ~0.02ms per call

**But it adds up:**
- 1000 strategies × 0.01-0.02ms = 10-20ms per bar
- Plus overhead of result processing and signal publishing

## Performance Projections

Based on measured performance:

**Per Bar (1000 strategies):**
- Feature update: ~1.1ms
- Readiness checking: ~20ms
- Strategy execution: ~15ms
- Other overhead: ~5ms
- **Total: ~41ms per bar**

**Full Backtest:**
- 1,000 bars: ~41 seconds
- 10,000 bars: ~410 seconds (6.8 minutes)
- 100,000 bars: ~4,100 seconds (68 minutes)

## Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Cache Strategy Readiness (High Impact)

After warmup, strategies don't need readiness checking every bar:

```python
class ComponentState:
    def __init__(self):
        self._ready_strategies = {}  # Cache ready strategies
        self._warmup_complete = {}   # Track warmup per symbol
    
    def _execute_components_individually(self, symbol, features, bar, timestamp):
        current_bars = self._bar_count.get(symbol, 0)
        
        # After warmup, use cached ready list
        if self._warmup_complete.get(symbol, False):
            ready_strategies = self._ready_strategies.get(symbol, [])
        else:
            # Only check readiness during warmup
            ready_strategies = self._check_readiness(symbol, features, current_bars)
            
            # Cache when warmup complete (e.g., after 200 bars)
            if current_bars >= 200:
                self._ready_strategies[symbol] = ready_strategies
                self._warmup_complete[symbol] = True
```

**Expected improvement:** ~20ms per bar (50% reduction)

### 2. Optimize Feature Computation (Medium Impact)

Only compute what changed:

```python
def _update_features(self, symbol: str) -> None:
    # Only append new values to existing features
    latest_bar = {field: deque[-1] for field, deque in self.price_data[symbol].items()}
    
    # Update only features that can be computed incrementally
    for feature_name, config in self.feature_configs.items():
        if self._can_update_incrementally(feature_name):
            self._update_feature_incrementally(symbol, feature_name, latest_bar)
        else:
            # Full recomputation only when necessary
            self._compute_feature_full(symbol, feature_name)
```

**Expected improvement:** ~0.5ms per bar

### 3. Batch Strategy Execution (Low-Medium Impact)

Process strategies in batches to improve cache locality:

```python
# Process strategies in batches of 100
BATCH_SIZE = 100
for i in range(0, len(ready_strategies), BATCH_SIZE):
    batch = ready_strategies[i:i + BATCH_SIZE]
    
    # Pre-fetch all required features for batch
    required_features = self._get_batch_features(batch, features)
    
    # Execute batch
    for strategy in batch:
        result = strategy['function'](required_features, bar, strategy['parameters'])
```

**Expected improvement:** ~2-3ms per bar

### 4. Sparse Signal Publishing (Low Impact)

Only publish non-zero signals:

```python
if result and result.get('signal_value', 0) != 0:
    self._publish_signal(signal)
```

Most strategies return 0 most of the time, so this reduces event overhead.

**Expected improvement:** ~1-2ms per bar

## Summary

The current performance of ~41ms per bar for 1000 strategies can be improved to ~15-20ms per bar with the recommended optimizations, primarily by:

1. **Eliminating redundant readiness checks** after warmup (biggest win)
2. **Optimizing feature computation** to be more incremental
3. **Improving execution patterns** for better cache usage

This would reduce a 100,000 bar backtest from 68 minutes to ~25-30 minutes.
