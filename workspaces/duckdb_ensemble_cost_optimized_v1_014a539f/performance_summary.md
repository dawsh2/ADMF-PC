# Cost-Optimized Ensemble Strategy Performance Analysis

## Executive Summary

The cost-optimized ensemble strategy shows **poor performance** compared to previous ensemble configurations:

- **Last 12k bars**: **-1.15%** (vs Default: +8.39%, Custom: -0.30%)
- **Last 22k bars**: **-0.64%**
- **Full Period**: **+12.24%** (but with significant drawdowns)

## Detailed Performance Metrics

### Last 12k Bars (Most Recent Period)
- **Total Return**: -1.15%
- **Number of Trades**: 2,182
- **Win Rate**: 43.4%
- **Average Trade P&L**: -0.000%
- **Maximum Drawdown**: -5.15%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: -0.506 (annualized)
- **Trading Frequency**: 181.8 trades per 1000 bars

### Last 22k Bars
- **Total Return**: -0.64%
- **Number of Trades**: 3,972
- **Win Rate**: 44.0%
- **Average Trade P&L**: -0.000%
- **Maximum Drawdown**: -5.15%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: -0.132 (annualized)

### Full Period (102k bars)
- **Total Return**: +12.24%
- **Number of Trades**: 18,336
- **Win Rate**: 44.7%
- **Average Trade P&L**: 0.001%
- **Maximum Drawdown**: -6.28%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 0.959 (annualized)

## Sparse Storage Analysis

The sparse signal storage is highly efficient:
- **Storage Efficiency**: Only 28.81% of bars stored
- **Average bars between signal changes**: 3.5
- **Compression Ratio**: 37.4x

Signal Distribution:
- Short signals (-1): 33.4%
- Neutral (0): 37.7%
- Long signals (1): 28.9%

## Trading Pattern Analysis (Last 12k bars)

### Long Trades
- Count: 979 trades
- Win Rate: 41.0%
- Average P&L: -0.001%
- Total Contribution: -0.84%

### Short Trades
- Count: 1,203 trades
- Win Rate: 45.3%
- Average P&L: -0.000%
- Total Contribution: -0.31%

## Key Findings

1. **Extremely High Trading Frequency**: The strategy trades ~180 times per 1000 bars, holding positions for only 4.1 bars on average. This would result in significant transaction costs in real trading.

2. **Poor Recent Performance**: The strategy has lost money in both the 12k and 22k bar periods, with negative Sharpe ratios indicating poor risk-adjusted returns.

3. **Low Win Rate**: With win rates below 45%, the strategy struggles to generate consistent profits.

4. **Small Edge Per Trade**: Average trade P&L is near zero (0.001% for full period), meaning the strategy has almost no edge per trade.

5. **Sparse Storage Works Well**: The implementation correctly stores only signal changes, achieving excellent compression while maintaining all necessary information for P&L calculation.

## Comparison to Previous Ensembles

| Strategy | Last 12k Bars Return |
|----------|---------------------|
| Default Ensemble | +8.39% |
| Custom Ensemble | -0.30% |
| **Cost-Optimized** | **-1.15%** |

The cost-optimized ensemble performs worse than both previous configurations, suggesting that the optimization for cost (likely through reduced complexity or simpler strategies) has come at the expense of performance.

## Recommendations

1. **Reduce Trading Frequency**: The current frequency is too high for practical implementation
2. **Improve Signal Quality**: Focus on higher conviction signals with better win rates
3. **Review Cost Optimization**: The trade-off between cost and performance appears unfavorable
4. **Consider Hybrid Approach**: Use cost-optimized strategies only in specific market regimes
