# DuckDB Ensemble V1 Performance Analysis - Log Returns

## Executive Summary

This analysis recalculates the performance of the `duckdb_ensemble_v1_6fae958f` strategy using proper log returns methodology, which correctly accounts for compounding effects in trading returns.

## Methodology

### Log Returns Calculation
For each trade `i`, the log return is calculated as:
```
t_i = log(price_exit / price_entry) * signal_value
```

Where:
- `price_exit`: Exit price of the trade
- `price_entry`: Entry price of the trade  
- `signal_value`: The signal direction (-1 for short, +1 for long)

### Total Performance Calculation
1. Sum all individual trade log returns: `total_log_return = Î£ t_i`
2. Convert to percentage return: `percentage_return = exp(total_log_return) - 1`

## Key Results

- **Total Log Return**: 0.106591
- **Percentage Return**: **11.25%**
- **Number of Trades**: 3,511
- **Win Rate**: 51.44%

## Comparison: Simple P&L vs Log Returns

| Metric | Full Period | Last 12k Bars |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Simple P&L** | $61.07 | $46.41 |
| **Log Returns** | **11.25%** | **8.57%** |
| **Approximate Simple %** | ~10.49% | ~8.19% |

## Why Log Returns Matter

1. **Compounding Effects**: Log returns properly account for the multiplicative nature of investment returns
2. **Mathematical Correctness**: When returns compound over time, log returns give the true performance
