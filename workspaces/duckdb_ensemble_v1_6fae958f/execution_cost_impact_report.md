# DuckDB Ensemble Execution Cost Impact Analysis

## Executive Summary

This analysis applies **aggressive execution costs** from `calc.py` defaults to the DuckDB ensemble performance, revealing the critical importance of execution cost assumptions in high-frequency trading strategies.

### Key Findings

ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL IMPACT**: The aggressive execution costs completely destroy the strategy's profitability:

- **Full Period**: 11.25% gross return â†’ **-96.87% net return** (108% cost drag)
- **Last 12k Bars**: 8.57% gross return â†’ **-86.44% net return** (95% cost drag)

## Execution Cost Assumptions (Aggressive)

Based on `src/execution/calc.py` defaults:

| Component | Value | Application |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Commission** | $0.005 per share | Both entry and exit |
| **Slippage** | 5 basis points (0.05%) | Both entry and exit |
| **Notional Size** | $1,000 per trade | For cost calculation |
| **Total Cost** | ~0.102% per trade | Combined commission + slippage Ã— 2 |

### Cost Calculation Method

```python
# For each trade:
shares = $1,000 / entry_price
commission_pct = (shares Ã— $0.005) / $1,000  # ~0.0017%
slippage_pct = 0.0005  # 5 bps = 0.05%
total_cost_pct = (commission_pct + slippage_pct) Ã— 2  # Entry + exit ~0.102%

# Apply to returns:
net_return = log(exit_price/entry_price) Ã— signal - total_cost_pct
```

### Last 12k Bars Results

| Metric | Gross | Net | Impact |
|--------|--------|-----|--------|
| **Total Return** | 8.57% | -86.44% | **-95.00%** |
| **Total Log Return** | 0.0822 | -1.9979 | **-2.0801** |

## Critical Insights

### 1. Cost Structure Impact
- **Average cost per trade**: 0.102% (10.2 basis points)
- **Trade frequency**: 3,511 trades over full period
- **Total cost burden**: 357+ basis points in execution costs alone

### 2. Strategy Characteristics Amplify Costs
- **High frequency**: Average 4.8 bars per trade (very short holding periods)
- **Frequent trading**: Strategy generates 3,511 trades in dataset
- **Small edge per trade**: Average gross log return only 0.000030 per trade
- **Cost exceeds edge**: 0.102% cost vs ~0.003% average gross profit per trade

### 3. Win Rate Collapse
The execution costs cause a dramatic shift in trade outcomes:
- **Gross win rate**: 51.44% (slight edge)
- **Net win rate**: 7.69% (devastating impact)
- **Impact**: 43.75 percentage point reduction in win rate

### 4. Cost Drag Analysis
- **Full period cost drag**: 961% of gross returns
- **Recent period cost drag**: 1,109% of gross returns
- **Implication**: Execution costs are ~10x larger than the strategy's gross edge

## Risk Assessment

### Worst-Case Scenario Confirmed
This analysis uses **aggressive but realistic** execution cost assumptions:

1. **Commission**: $0.005/share is realistic for retail/small institutional
2. **Slippage**: 5 bps is aggressive but possible in volatile markets
3. **Application**: Costs applied to both entry and exit (realistic)

### Strategy Viability
Under these cost assumptions, the strategy is **NOT VIABLE**:
- Net returns are dramatically negative
- Risk-adjusted returns are catastrophic
- Transaction costs completely overwhelm any alpha generation

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Actions
- **Reduce trading frequency** dramatically
- **Increase position holding periods** to amortize costs
- **Improve signal filtering** to reduce false signals
- **Negotiate better execution terms** if possible

### 2. Strategy Modifications
- **Signal threshold optimization**: Require higher conviction signals
- **Position sizing**: Larger positions to amortize fixed costs
- **Exit logic**: Less frequent exits, trend-following exits
- **Time-based filters**: Avoid low-volume periods

### 3. Cost Reduction Strategies
- **Commission negotiation**: Target <$0.001/share if possible
- **Execution venue optimization**: Dark pools, better routing
- **Order management**: Limit orders vs market orders
- **Batch execution**: Combine signals where possible

### 4. Alternative Approaches
- **Lower frequency strategies**: Target longer hold periods
- **Portfolio approaches**: Fewer, larger positions
- **Options strategies**: Different cost structures
- **Factor-based approaches**: Less transaction-intensive

## Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates that **execution costs are the primary determinant of strategy profitability** for high-frequency approaches. The DuckDB ensemble strategy, while showing positive gross returns, becomes completely unviable under realistic execution cost assumptions.

The key lesson: **No amount of signal sophistication can overcome excessive transaction costs.** Successful strategies must be designed with execution costs as a primary constraint, not an afterthought.

### Bottom Line
- **Gross Performance**: Respectable 11.25% return
- **Net Performance**: Catastrophic -96.87% loss
- **Root Cause**: High-frequency trading with insufficient edge per trade
- **Solution**: Fundamental strategy redesign to reduce transaction intensity
