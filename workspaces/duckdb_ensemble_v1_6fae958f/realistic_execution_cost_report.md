## Execution Cost Breakdown

### Cost Structure
- **Commission Cost**: 0.00% per trade (zero)
- **Slippage Cost**: 0.01% per trade (1 basis point)
- **Total Cost**: 0.01% per trade

### Total Cost Impact
- **Full Period**: 35.11% total drag (3,511 trades × 0.01%)
- **Last 12K Bars**: 20.44% total drag (2,044 trades × 0.01%)
- **Cost Drag**: 293% of gross return (full period)

## Trade Analysis

### Trade Duration Distribution
- **Short (≤2 bars)**: 1,926 trades (54.9%)
- **Medium (3-10 bars)**: 1,159 trades (33.0%)
- **Long (>10 bars)**: 426 trades (12.1%)

### Best and Worst Trades
- **Best Gross Trade**: +1.91% (becomes +1.90% net)
- **Worst Gross Trade**: -1.60% (becomes -1.61% net)
- **Impact**: Even best trades lose 1bp to execution costs

## Cost Sensitivity Analysis

| Cost Level (bp) | Total Drag | Assessment |
|-----------------|------------|------------|
| 0.5 bp | 17.6% | Severe |
| 1.0 bp | 35.1% | Prohibitive |
| 2.0 bp | 70.2% | Prohibitive |
| 5.0 bp | 175.6% | Prohibitive |

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. High Frequency Trading Problem
- Strategy trades 67 times per day
- Each trade costs 1bp, creating massive cumulative drag
- 54.9% of trades last only 1-2 bars

### 2. Execution Cost Dominance
- 1bp per trade creates 35% total drag
- Gross return of 11.25% becomes -21.69% net loss
- Cost drag is 293% of gross returns

### 3. Break-Even Requirements
- Strategy needs >35% gross return to be profitable
- Current gross return of 11.25% is insufficient
- High frequency amplifies cost impact

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Reduce Trade Frequency**: Implement minimum trade duration filters
2. **Signal Smoothing**: Reduce noise to eliminate marginal trades
3. **Position Sizing**: Trade larger amounts less frequently
4. **Trade Filtering**: Eliminate low-conviction signals

### Strategy Modifications
1. **Increase Minimum Hold Period**: Target 10+ bar minimum duration
2. **Batch Execution**: Combine multiple signals into single trades
3. **Threshold Adjustments**: Raise signal thresholds to reduce sensitivity
4. **Time-Based Exits**: Implement scheduled rebalancing vs. continuous

### Target Improvements
- **Reduce trades by 80%**: From 3,511 to ~700 trades
- **Increase average duration**: From 4.8 to 25+ bars
- **Lower cost drag**: From 35% to <7%
- **Maintain signal quality**: Preserve alpha while reducing noise

## Mathematical Validation

### Cost Calculation Method
```python
# For each trade:
execution_cost_pct = 0.0001  # 1 basis point
adjusted_trade_return = log(exit_price/entry_price) * signal_value - 0.0001

# Total impact:
total_cost_drag = number_of_trades × 0.0001
```

### Verification
- **3,511 trades × 0.01% = 35.11% total drag**
- **Gross 11.25% - 35.11% drag = -23.86% theoretical net** ✓
- **Actual net -21.69%** (slight difference due to compounding effects)

## Conclusion

The DuckDB ensemble strategy, while showing positive gross performance (+11.25%), becomes significantly unprofitable (-21.69%) when realistic 1bp execution costs are applied. The root cause is excessive trade frequency (67 trades/day) that amplifies minor per-trade costs into major performance drag.

**Strategy is NOT viable for live trading** without significant modifications to reduce trade frequency while preserving alpha generation capability.
