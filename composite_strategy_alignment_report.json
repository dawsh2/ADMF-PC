      "location": "FeatureHub._update_features()",
      "issue": "Features use current bar close in calculation",
      "severity": "CRITICAL",
      "explanation": "The feature hub calculates indicators using the current bar's close price and makes them immediately available to strategies. Strategies should only see features calculated up to the PREVIOUS bar.",
      "fix": "Lag all features by 1 bar before making them available to strategies"

      "location": "Strategy signal generation",
      "issue": "Signals can be executed on same bar they are generated",
      "severity": "HIGH",
      "explanation": "Strategies generate signals based on current bar features and those signals can be acted upon immediately. In reality, you can only execute after the bar closes.",
      "fix": "Add 1 bar delay between signal generation and execution"

      "location": "Feature calculation using pandas",
      "issue": "Using pandas rolling() includes current bar by default",
      "severity": "HIGH",
      "explanation": "df[\"close\"].rolling(10).mean() includes the current bar's close. This means the 10-period SMA \"knows\" the current price.",
      "fix": "Use .shift(1) after rolling calculations or calculate on close[:-1]"

  "recommendations": [
    "1. Modify FeatureHub to lag all features by 1 bar before making them available",
    "2. Add signal execution delay in the backtesting engine",
    "3. Include realistic transaction costs (commission + slippage)",
    "4. Re-run all backtests with these corrections",
    "5. Use the RobustBacktester class for future validations",
    "6. Always validate on true out-of-sample data (walk-forward analysis)"
