# WorkflowManager to TopologyBuilder Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Coordinator.py
- Changed import from `WorkflowManager` to `TopologyBuilder`
- Renamed `_execute_via_workflow_manager()` to `_execute_via_topology_builder()`
- Renamed `_get_workflow_manager()` to `_get_topology_builder()`
- Renamed `_get_workflow_manager_class()` to `_get_topology_builder_class()`
- Updated all references to use `topology_builder` instead of `workflow_manager`

### 2. Added Event Tracing Management to Coordinator
Added new methods to manage event tracing file structure and data storage:
- `_get_trace_storage_path()` - Get storage path for workflow traces
- `_save_event_trace()` - Save trace data to filesystem
- `_load_event_trace()` - Load trace data from filesystem  
- `_pass_trace_to_sequencer()` - Pass trace data to sequencer for multi-phase workflows
- `_extract_trace_from_result()` - Extract trace data from workflow results

The coordinator now automatically:
- Saves event trace data after workflow execution
- Passes trace data to sequencer for multi-phase workflows
- Stores traces in organized directory structure (`./traces/{workflow_id}/`)

### 3. Updated __init__.py
- Added `get_topology_builder()` function
- Made `get_workflow_manager` a backward compatibility alias to `get_topology_builder`
- Added both to `__all__` exports

### 4. Updated Test Files
Updated all test files to use TopologyBuilder:
- `test_simple_event_flow.py`
- `test_event_trace_flow.py`
- `test_event_flow_architecture.py`

### 5. Updated Sequencer.py
- Changed parameter from `workflow_manager` to `topology_builder` in `execute_phases()`
- Updated docstrings and comments

### 6. Updated Architecture Validation Script
- Changed references from `workflow_manager.py` to `topology.py`
- Updated validation checks for TopologyBuilder

### 7. Updated Workflow Execution Module
- Updated deprecation messages to reference TopologyBuilder

## Backward Compatibility

The following backward compatibility measures are in place:
1. `WorkflowManager = TopologyBuilder` alias at the bottom of `topology.py`
2. `get_workflow_manager = get_topology_builder` alias in `__init__.py`
3. Both functions are exported in `__all__`

This ensures existing code continues to work while encouraging migration to the new naming.

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Clearer Naming**: TopologyBuilder better reflects what the class does - it builds execution topologies
2. **Event Tracing Management**: Coordinator now properly manages event traces with:
   - Persistent storage to filesystem
   - Organized directory structure
   - Integration with sequencer for multi-phase workflows
   - Automatic extraction and storage of trace data
3. **Better Separation of Concerns**: 
   - TopologyBuilder focuses on building and executing topologies
   - Coordinator manages high-level orchestration and event trace persistence
   - Sequencer handles multi-phase workflow execution
