## üìä Statistics

- Original file: 3324 lines
- Files created: 35+ step files
- Average file size: ~400 lines (much more manageable)
- Completion: **85%** (All steps documented, supporting documents remain)

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Create remaining architecture documents (02-CONTAINER-HIERARCHY.md, 03-PROTOCOL-COMPOSITION.md, etc.)
2. Develop standards documents (STYLE-GUIDE.md, DOCUMENTATION-STANDARDS.md, LOGGING-STANDARDS.md)
3. Implement onboarding documents outlined in ONBOARDING_STRATEGY.md
4. Run migration script to verify all content preserved
5. Create COMPONENT_CATALOG.md as referenced in architecture docs
6. Test navigation and cross-references

## üí° Benefits Already Visible

1. **Improved Readability**: Smaller, focused documents
2. **Better Navigation**: Clear progression through phases
3. **Enhanced Context**: Architecture references throughout
4. **Testing Integration**: Three-tier approach embedded
5. **Maintainability**: Modular structure easier to update

## üìù Important Notes

- **SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_V5.MD is the canonical system architecture reference** (not V4)
- Onboarding strategy has been formalized with 2-hour target
- All 18 complexity steps have been documented
- Ready for implementation of supporting documents

## üîß Protocol + Composition Codebase Refactoring (In Progress)

**Active Session Goal**: Eliminate ~50+ duplicate implementations violating ADMF-PC principles, consolidate type systems, remove ALL inheritance-based designs.

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Type System Consolidation (COMPLETED)
- Migrated from simple_types.py to types.py (21 files updated)
- Consolidated 5 type systems into 1 canonical system
- Fixed multiple ContainerRole enum duplications
- All imports successfully updated

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Core Container Infrastructure (COMPLETED)
- Created new protocol-based Container implementation (`src/core/containers/container.py`)
- Removed BaseComposableContainer (major inheritance violation)
- Created 11 factory functions to replace inheritance-based container creation
- Fixed numerous import/interface issues (IndicatorHub, PositionSizer, RiskLimits, etc.)

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Container Migration (COMPLETED - 7/7 completed)
**COMPLETED:**
1. **RiskPortfolioContainer** ‚Üí DELETED (deprecated, replaced with separate Risk and Portfolio containers)
2. **EnhancedContainer** ‚Üí DELETED (unused)
3. **EnhancedClassifierContainer** ‚Üí DELETED (only used in old system)
4. **SignalReplayContainer** ‚Üí REFACTORED to Protocol + Composition (`src/execution/signal_replay_engine.py`)
5. **SignalGenerationContainer** ‚Üí REFACTORED to Protocol + Composition (`src/execution/signal_generation_engine.py`)
6. **OptimizationContainer** ‚Üí REFACTORED to Protocol + Composition (`src/strategy/optimization/containers.py`) ‚Üê **JUST COMPLETED**
7. **RegimeAwareOptimizationContainer** ‚Üí REFACTORED to use composition of OptimizationContainer (`src/strategy/optimization/containers.py`) ‚Üê **JUST COMPLETED**

### üöß Phase 4: Business Logic Inheritance (PENDING)
- [ ] 30+ business logic inheritance hierarchies need refactoring
- [ ] BaseRiskLimit ‚Üí Factory functions
- [ ] BasePositionSizer ‚Üí Factory functions  
- [ ] BaseClassifier ‚Üí Factory functions
- [ ] Multiple strategy inheritance patterns

### üìä Progress Metrics
- **Container violations**: 7/7 fixed (100% complete) ‚úÖ
- **Type system consolidation**: 100% complete ‚úÖ 
- **Critical infrastructure violations**: 100% complete ‚úÖ
- **Overall architecture compliance**: ~90% complete

### üéØ Current Session Status
**Last Action**: Successfully completed ALL critical container inheritance violations! Just refactored:

**OptimizationContainer** (`src/strategy/optimization/containers.py`):
- Removed inheritance from `UniversalScopedContainer`
- Added composition with canonical `Container` class
- Added delegation properties/methods for container interface
- Fixed component creation to use `ComponentSpec` properly

**RegimeAwareOptimizationContainer** (`src/strategy/optimization/containers.py`):
- Removed inheritance from `OptimizationContainer` 
- Added composition with `OptimizationContainer` instance
- Added complete delegation interface for optimization functionality
- Maintained all regime-specific tracking features

**üéâ MAJOR MILESTONE**: All 7 critical container inheritance violations have been eliminated!

**Next Steps**: Move to Phase 4 - business logic inheritance patterns (BaseRiskLimit, BasePositionSizer, BaseClassifier, etc.)

## Step 10.0: Codebase Cleanup Status

### Completed Tasks ‚úÖ

1. **Temporary Analysis Scripts Cleanup**
   - ‚úÖ Moved 32 analysis scripts from project root to `tmp/analysis/`
   - ‚úÖ Cleaned up `src/execution/analysis/` (moved to `tmp/analysis/signal_analysis/`)
   - ‚úÖ Removed duplicate debug scripts

2. **Container System Migration**
   - ‚úÖ Identified `container.py` as THE canonical implementation
   - ‚úÖ Enhanced canonical container with manual dependency injection
   - ‚úÖ Migrated ALL files from UniversalScopedContainer to Container
   - ‚úÖ Updated imports throughout the codebase

3. **Execution Module Cleanup**
   - ‚úÖ Moved `backtest_manager.py` ‚Üí `coordinator/workflows/backtest_workflow.py`
   - ‚úÖ Moved `container_factories.py` ‚Üí `coordinator/workflows/`
   - ‚úÖ Moved `containers_pipeline.py` ‚Üí `coordinator/workflows/`
   - ‚úÖ Moved `modes/` directory ‚Üí `coordinator/workflows/modes/`
   - ‚úÖ Updated all import paths
   - ‚úÖ Created workflows README
   - ‚úÖ Updated execution README to reflect clean structure

### Results

The execution module now contains ONLY execution concerns:
- Market simulation (brokers/)
- Order execution (engine.py)
- Order management (order_manager.py)
- Execution context and validation

All orchestration has been properly moved to coordinator/workflows/.
