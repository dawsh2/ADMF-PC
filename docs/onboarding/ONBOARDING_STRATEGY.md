## 🚨 Common Onboarding Pitfalls to Address

1. **Trying to write Python code instead of YAML**
   - Solution: Emphasize zero-code approach early
   - Show powerful YAML examples

2. **Not understanding event flow**
   - Solution: Visual diagrams in multiple places
   - Interactive examples

3. **Confusion about container hierarchy**
   - Solution: Start simple, build complexity
   - Use analogies (Russian dolls)

4. **Overwhelming with all features**
   - Solution: Progressive disclosure
   - Role-based learning paths

5. **Missing the Protocol + Composition benefits**
   - Solution: Concrete comparison examples
   - Show integration flexibility

3. Develop CONCEPTS.md with clear diagrams
4. Draft FIRST_TASK.md with guided tutorial

### Week 2: Supporting Documents
1. Compile FAQ.md from common questions
2. Create GLOSSARY.md with all terms
3. Write ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md
4. Develop role-specific learning paths

### Week 3: Integration
1. Update main README to point to onboarding
2. Add onboarding links throughout documentation
3. Create visual diagrams and flowcharts
4. Test with context-unaware users

### Week 4: Refinement
1. Gather feedback from new users
2. Iterate on unclear sections
3. Add more examples where needed
4. Create video walkthrough (optional)

## 🎯 Key Success Factors

1. **Start with Success** - First experience must work perfectly
2. **Progressive Complexity** - Don't overwhelm initially
3. **Multiple Learning Styles** - Visual, textual, hands-on
4. **Clear Navigation** - Always know where to go next
5. **Immediate Value** - Show results quickly

## 📚 Reference Documents Integration

The onboarding should seamlessly connect to:
- SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_V4.md - For deeper understanding
- COMPONENT_CATALOG.md - For available components
- Complexity Guide - For advanced learning
- API Reference - For detailed specifications

## 🔗 Next Steps

1. Review and approve this strategy
2. Begin creating the core onboarding documents
3. Test with fresh eyes (context-unaware agents)
4. Iterate based on feedback
5. Maintain and update regularly
