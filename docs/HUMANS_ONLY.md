Key ideas:
- [ ] event driven
- [ ] config driven
- [ ] isolated event buses + containers everywhere
- [ ] container structure is decoupled from event flow
- [ ] event communication is flexible via pluggable adapters
- [ ] coordinator handles process management sequencing to ensure consistent exeuction paths --> reproducible results
- [ ] coordinator workflows can be standardized, reused and composed
- [ ] same code is used in live as in backtesting
- [ ] parallelized backtesting, single pass over data 
- [ ] analysis phase between optimization and forward testing
