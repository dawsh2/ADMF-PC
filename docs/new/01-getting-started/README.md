# Getting Started with ADMF-PC

Welcome! This guide will have you running your first algorithmic trading backtest in under 30 minutes.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Basic familiarity with YAML
- No trading system experience required!

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd ADMF-PC

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Download Sample Data

```bash
python scripts/download_sample_data.py
```

This downloads SPY (S&P 500 ETF) data for testing.

### 3. Run Your First Backtest

```bash
python main.py config/simple_backtest.yaml
```

You should see output showing:
- Data loading progress
- Strategy signals
- Trade execution
- Performance metrics

**Congratulations!** You've just run a momentum strategy backtest without writing any code.

## ðŸŽ¯ What Just Happened?

You ran a complete algorithmic trading backtest using only a YAML configuration file. The system:

1. **Loaded Data**: Historical price data for SPY
2. **Calculated Indicators**: Moving averages for the momentum strategy  
3. **Generated Signals**: Buy/sell decisions based on momentum
4. **Managed Risk**: Position sizing and exposure limits
5. **Executed Trades**: Simulated order execution with realistic costs
6. **Reported Results**: Performance metrics and statistics

All of this happened through the configuration in `config/simple_backtest.yaml` - no programming required!

### Common Questions

**Q: How is this different from other trading systems?**  
A: ADMF-PC uses a revolutionary architecture where everything is configuration. No inheritance, no programming, just YAML files that describe what you want.

**Q: Can I add my own strategies?**  
A: Yes! You can integrate Python functions, scikit-learn models, or any code that generates signals. See [Custom Components](../08-advanced-topics/custom-components.md).

**Q: Does this work with real trading?**  
A: Yes! The same YAML configuration works for both backtesting and live trading. See [Live Trading Guide](../03-user-guide/live-trading.md).

**Q: How fast is it?**  
A: Very fast! Signal replay optimization runs 10-100x faster than traditional backtesting. See [Performance Benchmarks](../04-reference/performance-benchmarks.md).
