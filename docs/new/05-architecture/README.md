# Architecture Documentation

This section provides comprehensive architectural guidance for ADMF-PC, focusing on data flow patterns, system integration approaches, and production deployment considerations.

## üìö Architecture Sections

### [Data Flow Architecture](data-flow-architecture.md)
Complete analysis of how data moves through ADMF-PC from ingestion to execution, including:
- **Multi-Phase Data Flows**: How data transforms across optimization, validation, and execution phases
- **Container Data Boundaries**: Clean data interfaces between isolated containers
- **Event-Driven Transformations**: Type-safe data transformations through semantic events
- **Performance-Optimized Flows**: Signal replay and other optimization patterns
- **Production Data Pipelines**: Scaling data flow for institutional deployment

### [System Integration Architecture](system-integration-architecture.md)
Guidance for integrating ADMF-PC with external systems:
- **Broker Integration Patterns**: Clean integration with trading platforms
- **Data Feed Architecture**: Real-time and historical data integration
- **Risk System Integration**: Enterprise risk management connectivity
- **Monitoring and Observability**: Production monitoring integration
- **API Design Patterns**: Extensible interface design

### [Production Deployment Architecture](production-deployment-architecture.md)
Architecture patterns for production deployments:
- **Scaling Patterns**: Container scaling and resource management
- **High-Availability Design**: Fault tolerance and recovery
- **Security Architecture**: Data protection and access control
- **Performance Architecture**: Optimization strategies and benchmarking
- **Operational Excellence**: Monitoring, alerting, and maintenance

## üîç Architecture Principles

These documents follow key architectural principles:

**1. Data Flow Clarity**
- Clear data boundaries between system components
- Type-safe transformations with semantic events
- Performance-optimized flow patterns

**2. System Isolation**
- Clean interfaces between ADMF-PC and external systems
- Protocol-based integration patterns
- Fault isolation boundaries

**3. Production Readiness**
- Scalable architecture patterns
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability
- Enterprise-grade security and reliability

## üìñ How to Use This Documentation

**For System Architects**: Start with [Data Flow Architecture](data-flow-architecture.md) to understand core data movement patterns, then proceed to integration and deployment guides.

**For Integration Teams**: Focus on [System Integration Architecture](system-integration-architecture.md) for connecting ADMF-PC with existing infrastructure.

**For Operations Teams**: Review [Production Deployment Architecture](production-deployment-architecture.md) for scaling, monitoring, and operational patterns.
