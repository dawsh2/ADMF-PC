# Development Standards

Comprehensive standards and guidelines for ADMF-PC development, ensuring consistency, quality, and adherence to our architectural principles.

## üìö Standards Documents

### 1. [STYLE-GUIDE.md](STYLE-GUIDE.md)
Complete coding standards including:
- Protocol + Composition philosophy
- Zero inheritance rule
- Duck typing patterns
- Code organization
- Naming conventions

### 2. [DOCUMENTATION-STANDARDS.md](DOCUMENTATION-STANDARDS.md)
Documentation requirements:
- File header formats
- Function/class documentation
- Architectural references
- Logging integration

### 3. [LOGGING-STANDARDS.md](LOGGING-STANDARDS.md)
Structured logging guidelines:
- Event flow logging
- State change tracking
- Performance metrics
- Integration patterns

### 4. [TESTING-STANDARDS.md](TESTING-STANDARDS.md)
Testing requirements and patterns:
- Three-tier testing strategy
- Protocol-based testing
- Container isolation testing
- Coverage requirements

## üéØ Core Principles

### Protocol + Composition
- No inheritance hierarchies
- Behavior through composition
- Duck typing for flexibility
- Explicit protocols/interfaces

### Configuration-Driven
- YAML defines behavior
- No hardcoded values
- Environment-aware configs
- Runtime adaptability

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Loose coupling via events
- Isolated event buses
- Clear event contracts
- Asynchronous processing

### Container Isolation
- Complete state separation
- Resource boundaries
- Lifecycle management
- Parallel execution

## üîç Quick Reference

### Creating New Components
1. Define protocol first
2. Implement with composition
3. Add event emissions
4. Document thoroughly
5. Test in isolation

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Follows Protocol + Composition
- [ ] No inheritance used
- [ ] Proper event handling
- [ ] Comprehensive logging
- [ ] Tests included
- [ ] Documentation complete

## üìä Standards Compliance

All code must:
- Pass style checks
- Include proper documentation
- Have adequate test coverage
- Follow logging standards
- Use approved patterns

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Read the [STYLE-GUIDE.md](STYLE-GUIDE.md) first
2. Review documentation standards
3. Understand logging requirements
4. Study testing patterns
5. Apply consistently
