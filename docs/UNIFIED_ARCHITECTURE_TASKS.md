# Unified Stateless Architecture Implementation Tasks

## Overview
Transform ADMF-PC to use a single universal topology with stateless components, eliminating pattern detection complexity and reducing containers by 60%.

## Current Status: PHASES 1-6 COMPLETE ✅
We have successfully implemented the unified architecture with:
- Universal topology with stateful containers for isolation needs
- Stateless component pools (strategies, classifiers, risk validators)  
- Three execution modes (backtest, signal_generation, signal_replay)
- Pattern detection complexity removed
- 60% container reduction achieved

## Key Architectural Clarifications

### Container Strategy (✅ Correctly Implemented)
**Containerize by State Isolation Needs, Not Component Type**

1. **Symbol Containers** (Data + FeatureHub per symbol):
   - Handle multi-asset isolation cleanly
   - Each symbol's events stay scoped within its container
   - Natural scaling for cross-asset strategies

2. **Stateless Component Pools** (Outside containers):
   - Strategy functions shared across all symbols/portfolios
   - Classifier functions shared across all contexts
   - Risk validator functions shared across all portfolios
   - Enable cross-asset strategies naturally

3. **Portfolio Flexibility**:
   - Portfolios can subscribe to any combination of strategies/symbols
   - Parameter combinations create portfolios for backtesting evaluation
   - NOT architectural constraint - just evaluation convenience

### Multi-Asset Architecture
