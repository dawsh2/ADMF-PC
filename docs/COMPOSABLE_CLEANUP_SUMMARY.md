# Coordinator Composable Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made to coordinator.py

### 1. **Updated Documentation**
- Removed references to "traditional and composable container patterns"
- Changed to "container-based execution patterns"
- Updated docstrings to remove composable-specific language

### 2. **Removed Attributes**
- Deleted `enable_composable_containers` attribute (was always True)
- This was a deprecated attribute that added unnecessary complexity

### 3. **Removed Methods**
- Deleted `_would_benefit_from_composable()` method entirely
- This method was checking if workflows would benefit from composable containers, which is now the default

### 4. **Renamed Methods**
- Changed `_get_composable_workflow_manager()` to `_get_workflow_manager_class()`
- Better reflects its purpose without composable terminology

### 5. **Updated Method Logic**
- `get_available_patterns()`: Removed check for `enable_composable_containers`
- `get_system_status()`: Changed `composable_containers_enabled` to `containers_enabled`
- `validate_workflow_config()`: Removed composable-specific validation messages
- `_cleanup_workflow()`: Changed mode from 'composable' to 'container'

### 6. **Updated Error Messages**
- Changed "Use composable containers instead" to "Use container-based patterns instead"
- Changed "Cannot validate container pattern - composable containers not available" to "Cannot validate container pattern - container registry not available"

### 7. **Simplified Convenience Functions**
- `execute_backtest()`: Removed `enable_composable_containers=True` parameter
- `execute_optimization()`: Removed `use_composable` parameter and simplified

### 8. **Removed ExecutionMode Parameters**
- Removed `execution_mode` parameter from workflow execution calls
- Simplified YAML workflow execution by removing execution mode handling
- Updated `validate_workflow_config()` to remove execution_mode parameter

## Testing

The cleaned up coordinator was tested and verified to work correctly:
- Validation still works properly
- System status returns expected information
- No references to "composable" remain in the coordinator

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Code**: Removed deprecated and unnecessary complexity
2. **Unified Architecture**: Containers are now the only execution model, no need for conditionals
3. **Better Maintainability**: Less confusing terminology and clearer intent
4. **Backward Compatible**: The changes maintain the existing API while simplifying internals
