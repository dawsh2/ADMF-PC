     │ - This happens for EVERY strategy that has an intraday filter                             │

     │ - During warmup (first 200 bars), checks readiness for ALL strategies on EVERY bar        │
     │ - With 1500 strategies, this is potentially expensive                                     │
     │ - Uses a cache after warmup, but warmup itself is slow                                    │
