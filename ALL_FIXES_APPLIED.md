# All Fixes Applied - Ready to Run!

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### 1. Exit Memory Fix (strategy_id propagation)
**File**: `src/portfolio/state.py`
- Added `metadata` parameter to `update_position()` method
- Pass strategy_id when creating positions from fills
- Ensures exit memory can track which strategy exited

### 2. OHLC Data in Signals
**File**: `src/strategy/strategies/indicators/volatility.py`
- Updated Bollinger Bands strategy to include OHLC data in metadata:
  ```python
  'open': bar.get('open', 0),
  'high': bar.get('high', 0), 
  'low': bar.get('low', 0),
  'close': bar.get('close', 0),
  ```

### 3. Intrabar Exit Price Checking
**File**: `src/risk/strategy_risk_manager.py`
- Extract OHLC data from signals
- Use LOW price to check if stop loss hit (for long positions)
- Use HIGH price to check if take profit hit (for long positions)
- Opposite for short positions

## What These Fixes Solve

1. **Exit Memory**: Prevents immediate re-entry after stop loss/take profit exits
2. **Accurate Exit Prices**: Uses actual high/low of bar to determine if exits were hit
3. **Correct Trade Count**: Should reduce from 453 to ~416 trades
4. **Proper Performance**: Should match notebook results (~10.27% return)

## Next Steps

1. **Clear Python cache and restart**:
   ```bash
   # Stop current Python (Ctrl+C)
   ./clear_python_cache.sh
   ```

2. **Run the backtest**:
   ```bash
   python main.py --config config/bollinger/test.yaml
   ```

3. **Verify results**:
   ```bash
   # After backtest completes
   python analyze_suspicious_exits.py
   python verify_exit_memory_fix.py
   ```

## Expected Results

- Trade count: ~416 (down from 453)
- No immediate re-entries after risk exits
- Stop losses exit at -0.075%, not +0.075%
- Performance matching notebook: ~10.27% return, 91.1% win rate

The critical fix was adding OHLC data so the risk manager can accurately check if stop loss or take profit levels were hit during each bar!
