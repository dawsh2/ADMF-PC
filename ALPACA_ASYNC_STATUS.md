# Alpaca Async Execution - Working!

## Current Status âœ…

The --alpaca flag now automatically:

1. **Enables async execution mode**
   - Sets `execution_mode: async` in the execution config
   - Uses the clean async execution engine from `clean_engine.py`

2. **Creates async Alpaca broker**
   - Connects to Alpaca API with your credentials
   - Uses paper trading by default for safety
   - Supports WebSocket trade updates

3. **Wires portfolio to execution**
   - Portfolio state is automatically connected to execution engine
   - Fills update portfolio positions in real-time

## Confirmed Working

From the logs we can see:
```
âœ… ðŸš€ Enabled async execution with Alpaca broker
âœ… Created async Alpaca execution engine
âœ… Portfolio connected to execution engine
âœ… Starting clean async execution engine
âœ… Authenticated to Alpaca account: PA3TQE8YVIOA
âœ… Successfully connected to broker
âœ… Connected to Alpaca trade updates WebSocket
âœ… WebSocket order updates enabled
âœ… Execution engine started successfully
```

## Architecture

The clean async implementation provides:

- **Async I/O**: All broker communication is non-blocking
- **Clean boundaries**: Sync core (strategies) with async edges (broker)
- **Real-time updates**: WebSocket for instant fill notifications
- **Thread safety**: Proper event queue between sync/async
- **No complex bridges**: Simple, maintainable design

## Usage

Simply run:
```bash
python main.py --config your_config.yaml --alpaca
```

This automatically:
- Uses live Alpaca data streaming
- Enables async order execution
- Connects to your paper trading account
- Processes orders asynchronously

## Next Steps

To place live orders:
1. Ensure your strategy generates SIGNAL events
2. Risk manager converts signals to ORDER events
3. Async execution engine submits to Alpaca
4. Fills come back via WebSocket
5. Portfolio updates automatically

The system is ready for live paper trading!
