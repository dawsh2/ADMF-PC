# Stop Loss and Take Profit Execution Fix

## Problem
Stop losses and take profits were exiting at market price instead of the calculated stop/target prices. For example:
- Stop loss set at -0.075% was exiting at -0.09% or -0.13% (market price when triggered)
- Take profit set at +0.15% was exiting at +0.24% or +0.85% (market price when triggered)

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `SyncExecutionEngine` (src/execution/synchronous/engine.py). While the risk manager correctly calculated exit prices and the portfolio state passed them in orders, the execution engine was treating all market orders the same - applying market price and slippage.

## Solution
Modified the execution engine to check if an order is an exit order (stop_loss, take_profit, or trailing_stop) and use the exact price specified in the order instead of applying market price and slippage.

### Code Changes

**File: src/execution/synchronous/engine.py**

```python
# Check if this is an exit order with a specific price
exit_type = order.metadata.get('exit_type')

if exit_type in ['stop_loss', 'take_profit', 'trailing_stop'] and order.price and float(order.price) > 0:
    # Use the exact exit price specified in the order
    execution_price = float(order.price)
    self.logger.info(f"âœ… Using exact {exit_type} price: ${execution_price:.4f}")
else:
    # Regular market order - use market price with slippage
    # ... existing logic ...
```

## Verification
Created test script that confirms:
- Stop loss orders exit at exact stop price (e.g., 99.925 for -0.075%)
- Take profit orders exit at exact target price (e.g., 100.15 for +0.15%)
- Regular market orders still use market price

## Impact
This fix ensures that backtest results accurately reflect the intended risk management strategy:
- Stop losses exit at exactly -0.075% loss
- Take profits exit at exactly +0.15% gain
- Risk/reward ratios are preserved as designed (2:1 ratio)

## Next Steps
Run full backtest with the fix to see improved results where stops and targets execute at precise levels.
