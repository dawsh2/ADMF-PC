## ðŸš€ Ready for Step 3

The Step 2 implementation provides a solid foundation for Step 3. Key integration points for next steps:

1. **Event Bus Architecture**: Ready for additional containers
2. **Risk Management**: Extensible for multiple risk containers
3. **Portfolio State**: Supports multiple symbols and complex positions
4. **Testing Infrastructure**: Framework for testing multi-container scenarios

## ðŸ”§ Known Limitations

1. **Import Dependencies**: Some circular import issues exist between risk/execution modules that need resolution for full system integration
2. **Simplified Risk Models**: Step 2 uses basic risk calculations - more sophisticated models can be added in later steps
3. **Market Order Only**: Step 2 focuses on market orders - order types can be expanded in execution improvements

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps (Step 3)

Based on the complexity guide, Step 3 should focus on:
1. **Classifier Container**: Add market regime classification
2. **Enhanced Signal Processing**: Multi-factor signal combination
3. **Cross-Container Coordination**: Strategy + Risk + Classifier integration

The Step 2 foundation is ready to support these enhancements with its robust event-driven architecture and comprehensive risk management capabilities.
