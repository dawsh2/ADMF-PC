# You Must Re-run the Backtest!

## Current Situation

Your latest results (463 trades) were generated BEFORE the fixes were applied:
- ❌ Signals do NOT have OHLC data (open, high, low, close)
- ❌ Position events don't have strategy_id as a column
- ❌ Exit memory cannot work without these

## The Fixes ARE in the Code

I verified that `src/strategy/strategies/indicators/volatility.py` has the OHLC fix:
```python
'open': bar.get('open', 0),
'high': bar.get('high', 0),
'low': bar.get('low', 0),
'close': bar.get('close', 0),
```

## What You Need to Do

1. **Clear Python cache completely**:
```bash
# Stop any running Python
# Then:
./clear_python_cache.sh
```

2. **Exit and restart Python**:
```bash
# If in Python shell: exit()
# If script is running: Ctrl+C
# Close terminal and open new one if needed
```

3. **Run the backtest again**:
```bash
python main.py --config config/bollinger/test.yaml
```

4. **Then analyze the new results**:
```bash
python analyze_latest_results.py
python debug_463_trades.py
```

## Expected Changes

With the fixes properly applied:
- Signals will have OHLC data
- Risk manager will use high/low for accurate exit checks
- Exit memory might start working (if strategy_id propagates)
- Trade count might change (could go up or down)
- Performance should be different

## Important

The 463 trades you're seeing are from the OLD code without fixes. You must run the backtest again to see the effect of the changes!
