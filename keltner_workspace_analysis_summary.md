# Keltner Workspace Analysis Summary

## Workspace Details
- **Path**: `/Users/daws/ADMF-PC/workspaces/optimize_keltner_with_filters_20250622_102448`
- **Strategies Tested**: 45 variations of Keltner Bands
- **Data**: SPY 5-minute bars
- **Period**: 2024-03-26 to 2025-04-02

## Performance Results

### Overall Statistics
- **Total strategies tested**: 45
- **Strategies with positive returns**: 0 (0%)
- **Average return**: -125.00%
- **Best return**: -3.09% (Strategy 20)
- **Worst return**: -256.44%
- **Average Sharpe**: -96.72
- **Best Sharpe**: -67.85

### Top 5 Strategies (Least Negative)
1. **SPY_5m_compiled_strategy_20**: -3.09% return, 23 trades, 17.4% win rate
2. **SPY_5m_compiled_strategy_15**: -13.55% return, 80 trades, 12.5% win rate  
3. **SPY_5m_compiled_strategy_21**: -26.03% return, 151 trades, 8.6% win rate
4. **SPY_5m_compiled_strategy_10**: -44.17% return, 267 trades, 8.2% win rate
5. **SPY_5m_compiled_strategy_22**: -46.22% return, 264 trades, 7.2% win rate

### Trade Frequency Analysis
- **< 1 trade/day**: Avg return -14.22%, Best Sharpe -110.38
- **1-2 trades/day**: Avg return -60.25%, Best Sharpe -94.19
- **2-5 trades/day**: Avg return -141.19%, Best Sharpe -67.85
- **5-10 trades/day**: Avg return -236.41%, Best Sharpe -71.00

## Stop Loss Analysis

### Impact of Stop Losses (Average Across All Strategies)
- **No Stop**: -125.00% return
- **0.1% Stop**: -52.62% return (58% improvement)
- **0.2% Stop**: -80.89% return (35% improvement)
- **0.3% Stop**: -95.80% return (23% improvement)
- **0.5% Stop**: -109.11% return (13% improvement)
- **1.0% Stop**: -120.14% return (4% improvement)

Stop losses help but don't make strategies profitable. Tight stops (0.1%) show best improvement but still negative returns.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Filter Configuration Problem
The configuration uses filters with syntax: `signal == 0 or [condition]`

This is fundamentally flawed because:
- When no position (signal == 0), the filter always passes
- This makes the filter ineffective for entry signals
- Should be: `signal != 0 and [condition]` for entry filters

### 2. Parameter Range Issues
- **Period range (10-50)**: Too wide, includes very fast periods that generate noise
- **Multiplier range (1.0-3.0)**: Includes very tight bands that generate too many false signals
- Previous successful configs used periods around 40-50 with specific multipliers

### 3. Wrong Timeframe/Data Issues
- Previous analysis showed 1-minute Keltner could achieve 2.44 bps edge with ultra-selective parameters
- 5-minute was expected to show 2-5x better edge than 1-minute
- Current results suggest fundamental implementation or data issues

## Comparison to Previous Analyses

### Previous Successful Configuration (1-minute data)
- **Strategy 20**: Period=50, Multiplier=1.0
- **Performance**: 2.44 bps per trade, 59.1% win rate
- **Frequency**: 0.2 trades/day (ultra-selective)
- **Annual return**: 1.3% after costs

### Expected 5-minute Performance
- Should show 2-5x better edge than 1-minute
- Expected 0.5+ bps base edge for profitability
- Current results show -100%+ returns, indicating serious issues

## Recommendations

### 1. Fix Filter Implementation
```yaml
# Current (broken):
filter: "signal == 0 or rsi(14) < 50"

# Fixed:
filter: "signal != 0 and rsi(14) < 50"
```

### 2. Test Proven Parameters
Based on previous analyses:
- Period: 40, 45, 50
- Multiplier: 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5
- Focus on ultra-selective configurations

### 3. Verify Data Quality
- Check for data alignment issues
- Verify price data is clean and continuous
- Ensure signals are properly aligned with price bars

### 4. Re-run with Fixed Configuration
Create new configuration with:
- Fixed filter syntax
- Narrower parameter ranges based on successful configs
- Proper stop loss implementation
- Time-of-day filters

### 5. Alternative Approach
Given all strategies show negative returns, consider:
- Different strategy types (momentum, breakout)
- Different timeframes (15-minute, 30-minute)
- Different instruments (more volatile assets)

## Conclusion

The current workspace shows universally poor performance, likely due to:
1. Broken filter implementation making filters ineffective
2. Poor parameter choices generating too many false signals
3. Possible data or implementation issues

The fact that ALL 45 strategies show significant negative returns (worst: -256%) suggests systematic issues rather than just poor parameter choices. Previous analyses showed Keltner can work with ultra-selective parameters, so the current results indicate configuration or implementation problems that need to be addressed.
