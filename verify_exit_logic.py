print("=== Exit Checking Logic Verification ===")

print("\nCurrent Implementation:")
print("1. For LONG positions:")
print("   - Check if LOW <= stop_loss_price")
print("   - If yes: exit at stop loss")
print("   - If no: check if HIGH >= take_profit_price")
print("   - If yes: exit at take profit")
print("   - Otherwise: check other conditions with close")

print("\n2. For SHORT positions:")
print("   - Check if HIGH >= stop_loss_price")
print("   - If yes: exit at stop loss")
print("   - If no: check if LOW <= take_profit_price")
print("   - If yes: exit at take profit")
print("   - Otherwise: check other conditions with close")

print("\n\n=== So Why 463 Trades? ===")

print("\nPossible reasons for INCREASED trades (453 â†’ 463):")
print("\n1. More accurate exit detection:")
print("   - Before: Only checking close price, missing some exits")
print("   - Now: Checking high/low, catching ALL exits")
print("   - This could mean MORE positions cycling through")

print("\n2. Exit memory still not working:")
print("   - Even with accurate exits, immediate re-entries happen")
print("   - Need to verify strategy_id is propagating")

print("\n3. Different exit prices changing behavior:")
print("   - Exits at exact SL/TP prices instead of close prices")
print("   - This changes P&L and subsequent signals")

print("\n\n=== What to Check ===")
print("1. Run: python debug_463_trades.py")
print("   - See how many immediate re-entries")
print("   - Check if stop losses have gains")

print("\n2. The notebook might be using close price for exits")
print("   - This would be less accurate but match your 453")
print("   - Our OHLC fix is MORE accurate but different")

print("\n3. We might need to match the notebook's logic exactly")
print("   - Even if it's less accurate!")
