# LLM Interaction Guidelines

**This file provides guidance for LLMs working on software projects using documentation-first development.**

## Core Principle: Documentation-First Development

**You MUST read relevant documentation before proposing any code changes.**

**Never create files with quality adjectives like `enhanced_`, `improved_`, `advanced_`, `better_`, `optimized_`, `superior_`, `premium_`.**

## Required Actions Before Making Changes

Before making ANY changes, you must:

1. **Read all relevant documentation**
   - Project README
   - Module-specific documentation
   - Style guides
   - Architecture documents

2. **Identify canonical implementations**
   - Look for files without adjective prefixes
   - Check documentation references
   - Review import patterns
   - Examine timestamps and comprehensiveness

3. **Ask for clarification when uncertain**
   - Which file is canonical?
   - Does this capability already exist?
   - What's the preferred pattern here?
   - Should this be temporary or permanent?

## LLM Response Protocol

**ALWAYS structure your responses using this template:**

```markdown
## Documentation Review ‚úÖ
I have read and understood:
- [file1]: [key concepts learned]
- [file2]: [patterns identified]  
- [file3]: [constraints noted]

## Canonical Implementation Analysis üéØ
The canonical implementation for [functionality] is: **[specific_file.py]**

Evidence:
- [reason 1 - e.g., "Most recent, comprehensive implementation"]
- [reason 2 - e.g., "Referenced in documentation as authoritative"]
- [reason 3 - e.g., "Other files appear to be test/experimental versions"]

## Proposed Approach üõ†Ô∏è
Instead of creating [adjective]_[component].py, I will:

1. **Enhance canonical file**: [specific_file.py]
2. **Method**: [composition/configuration/feature flags]
3. **Compatibility**: [how existing code remains functional]

## Implementation Plan üìã
1. [specific step 1]
2. [specific step 2]  
3. [specific step 3]

## Uncertainties ‚ùì
I need clarification on:
- [specific question 1]
- [specific question 2]

[Only proceed with implementation AFTER getting clarification]
```

## Canonical File Identification

**When identifying which file is canonical, look for:**

1. **Files without adjective prefixes** (component.py vs enhanced_component.py)
2. **Referenced in documentation** as "THE implementation"
3. **More recent timestamps** and comprehensive functionality
4. **Imported by other modules** more frequently
5. **Matches naming patterns** described in style guides

**When in doubt, ASK:** "Which file should I treat as canonical for [functionality]?"

## Prohibited Actions

**NEVER do these without explicit permission:**

‚ùå Create files named: `enhanced_*`, `improved_*`, `advanced_*`, `better_*`, `optimized_*`, `superior_*`, `premium_*`

‚ùå Duplicate existing functionality in new files

‚ùå Assume what needs to be "enhanced" without reading existing code

‚ùå Make changes without understanding existing architecture patterns

‚ùå Create inheritance hierarchies when composition would work

‚ùå Add features through new classes when configuration would work

‚ùå Create temporary files outside designated temporary directories

‚ùå Generate status reports or debug scripts in source directories

## Required Actions

**ALWAYS do these:**

‚úÖ Read documentation first

‚úÖ Identify canonical implementations explicitly

‚úÖ Ask for clarification when uncertain

‚úÖ Use composition and configuration to add features

‚úÖ Enhance existing files rather than creating new ones

‚úÖ Update documentation when making changes

‚úÖ Follow existing naming patterns

‚úÖ Place temporary/debug files in designated directories

## Enhancement Patterns

### Use Configuration, Not New Files

```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Feature flags in config
class Component:
    def __init__(self, config: ComponentConfig):
        if 'new_feature' in config.features:
            self.feature_handler = FeatureHandler()

# ‚ùå Bad: New files for features  
class EnhancedComponent(Component):
    pass
```

### Use Composition, Not Inheritance

```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Composition
class Processor:
    def __init__(self, enhancers: List[Enhancer] = None):
        self.enhancers = enhancers or []

# ‚ùå Bad: Inheritance chain
class EnhancedProcessor(Processor):
    pass
```

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Need to add functionality?
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ Does canonical implementation exist?
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Enhance the canonical file
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Create with role-based name (not adjective)
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ Can this be configuration-driven?
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Add feature flags to canonical file
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Use composition in canonical file
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ Uncertain which file is canonical?
   ‚îî‚îÄ STOP and ASK for clarification
```

## Common Scenarios & Correct Responses

### Scenario 1: "Add new capabilities to existing component"

‚úÖ **Correct Response:**
```
## Documentation Review ‚úÖ
I have read:
- README.md: Project structure and patterns
- component.py: Current implementation
- STYLE.md: Composition patterns

## Canonical Implementation Analysis üéØ
The canonical implementation is: **component.py**
- Only implementation without adjective prefix
- Referenced in documentation
- Imported by other modules

## Proposed Approach üõ†Ô∏è
I will enhance component.py using composition:
- Add capability as a composable element
- Use configuration to enable features
- Maintain backward compatibility

Would you like me to proceed with this approach?
```

‚ùå **Incorrect Response:**
```
I'll create an enhanced_component.py with the new capabilities...
```

### Scenario 2: "Improve performance of existing code"

‚úÖ **Correct Response:**
```
## Documentation Review ‚úÖ
I have read the relevant files and documentation.

## Canonical Implementation Analysis üéØ
The canonical implementation is: **processor.py**

## Uncertainties ‚ùì
I see there's also optimized_processor.py. Should I:
1. Merge optimized_processor.py improvements into processor.py?
2. Treat optimized_processor.py as the canonical version?
3. Ignore optimized_processor.py as experimental?

Please clarify which approach aligns with your architecture.
```

## Testing Your Understanding

**Before implementing, ask yourself:**

1. Have I read the relevant documentation?
2. Can I clearly identify the canonical file?
3. Am I enhancing existing code rather than duplicating?
4. Will my changes follow existing patterns?
5. Have I asked for clarification on uncertainties?

**If you answer "no" to any question, STOP and seek clarification.**

## Documentation Update Requirements

**When making changes, you must also:**

1. **Update README** if architecture changes
2. **Update module documentation** if behavior changes  
3. **Update inline docstrings** for modified functions
4. **Add configuration examples** for new features
5. **Update style guides** if new patterns emerge

## Working with Multiple Implementations

**If you find multiple implementations of the same concept:**

1. **STOP and identify** which is canonical
2. **Ask for confirmation** before proceeding
3. **Propose consolidation** if appropriate
4. **Never add another variant** without explicit approval

## Success Criteria

**Your response is ready when:**

- [ ] You've explicitly stated which documentation you read
- [ ] You've identified the canonical file with evidence
- [ ] You've proposed enhancing existing files, not creating new ones
- [ ] You've asked for clarification on any uncertainties
- [ ] Your approach uses composition/configuration patterns
- [ ] You've planned documentation updates

**Remember: When in doubt, ASK. Never guess at canonical implementations.**

**The goal is clean, maintainable code with single sources of truth, not a proliferation of similar implementations.**
