"""
Detailed Exit Timing Analysis

Analyzes performance for each bar from 10-20 to find optimal exit timing patterns.
Then combines with MAE/MFE analysis to build a comprehensive exit framework.

Framework:
1. 20-bar hard stop (safety net)
2. Signal-based early exits (mean reversion, slow RSI, etc.)
3. MAE/MFE based dynamic exits (ride winners, cut losers)
4. Pattern-based exits (volume, volatility, time-of-day, etc.)
