# BACKTEST.MD Implementation Summary

## Current State

We have created the foundational pieces for implementing BACKTEST.MD:

1. **Clean Coordinator** (`coordinator_clean.py`):
   - No execution logic, only orchestration
   - Delegates to specialized containers
   - No circular dependencies

2. **Backtest Container Factory** (`src/core/containers/backtest/factory.py`):
   - Three patterns: Full, Signal Replay, Signal Generation
   - Standardized creation process
   - Proper container hierarchy

3. **Clean Workflow Managers** (`managers_clean.py`):
   - BacktestWorkflowManager
   - OptimizationWorkflowManager (with 3 phases)
   - LiveWorkflowManager

4. **Execution Modes** (`src/execution/modes.py`):
   - Moved out of coordinator to avoid circular dependency

## What Still Needs Implementation

### 1. Core Components

**IndicatorHub** (`src/strategy/indicators/indicator_hub.py`):
```python
class IndicatorHub:
    """Compute indicators once, share with all strategies."""
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.indicators = {}
    
    def process_bar(self, bar):
        # Compute all indicators
        # Emit indicator events
```

**DataStreamer** (`src/data/streamers.py`):
```python
class HistoricalDataStreamer:
    """Stream historical data to consumers."""
    
class SignalLogStreamer:
    """Stream saved signals for replay."""
```

**Container Protocols** (`src/core/containers/protocols.py`):
```python
class Container(Protocol):
    """Base container protocol."""
    def create_subcontainer(self, container_id: str) -> Container: ...
    def register_singleton(self, name: str, factory: Callable): ...
    def execute(self) -> Dict[str, Any]: ...
```

### 2. Event System Enhancement

The current EventBus needs scoping per container:
```python
class ScopedEventBus:
    """Event bus scoped to a container and its children."""
    def __init__(self, parent_bus: Optional[EventBus] = None):
        self.local_bus = EventBus()
        self.parent_bus = parent_bus
```

### 3. Risk & Portfolio Separation

Currently Risk and Portfolio are often combined. Per BACKTEST.MD they should be:
- **Risk Manager**: Signal assessment, position sizing, exposure limits
- **Portfolio**: Track positions, calculate P&L, manage state

### 4. Strategy Signal Generation

Strategies should ONLY generate signals, not manage positions:
```python
class Strategy(Protocol):
    def process_bar(self, bar: Bar, indicators: Dict) -> Optional[Signal]: ...
```

### 5. Backtest Engine Refactor

Current backtest engine does too much. Should only:
- Execute orders
- Generate fills
- Track performance

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Foundation (This Week)
1. ✅ Create clean coordinator
2. ✅ Create container factories
3. ✅ Create workflow managers
4. ⏳ Implement missing core components
5. ⏳ Update container lifecycle to support subcontainers

### Phase 2: Components (Next Week)
1. Implement IndicatorHub
2. Implement DataStreamers
3. Separate Risk and Portfolio
4. Refactor strategies to only generate signals
5. Clean up backtest engine

### Phase 3: Integration (Week 3)
1. Wire up event flows
2. Test three patterns (Full, Replay, Generation)
3. Update main.py to use new architecture
4. Remove all old implementations

### Phase 4: Optimization (Week 4)
1. Implement walk-forward with new architecture
2. Test massive parallelization
3. Performance tuning
4. Documentation

## Key Decisions Made

1. **No Circular Dependencies**: Coordinator doesn't know about execution details
2. **Protocol-Based**: Using protocols instead of inheritance
3. **Factory Pattern**: Ensures consistent container creation
4. **Three Patterns**: Full, Signal Replay, Signal Generation
5. **Clean Separation**: Each component has single responsibility

## Benefits When Complete

1. **Massive Parallelization**: Run 1000s of backtests confidently
2. **Reproducibility**: Same config always produces same container
3. **Performance**: 
   - Indicator computation shared
   - Signal replay 10-100x faster
   - Signal generation for analysis
4. **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries, easy to test
5. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new strategies, classifiers, risk profiles

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Implement DataStreamer classes
2. Implement IndicatorHub
3. Create Container protocol
4. Update UniversalScopedContainer to support subcontainers properly
5. Test basic Full backtest pattern end-to-end

The architecture is sound and follows BACKTEST.MD. Now we need to implement the missing pieces and wire everything together.
