# TraceQuery was designed to query phase outputs from event traces,
# but this violates the architecture principle that the Coordinator 
# (orchestration layer) should not be part of the event system.
# 
# For querying trading events (signals, fills, etc), use the 
# analytics and result extraction modules instead.
