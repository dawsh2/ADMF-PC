print("""
Expected impact of realistic execution:

1. ENTRY SLIPPAGE:
   - Current: Entry at signal bar close
   - Realistic: Entry at next bar open
   - Impact: ~0.01-0.02% average slippage

2. EXIT SLIPPAGE:
   - Current: Exit at exact stop/target
   - Realistic: Exit at bar close when touched
   - Impact: Targets might not capture full 0.1% move

3. GAPS:
   - Current: Always fill at stop
   - Realistic: Might gap through stop
   - Impact: Occasional large losses on gaps

ESTIMATED TOTAL IMPACT: 
- Reduce returns by 10-20%
- Reduce Sharpe by 10-30%
- Increase stop losses by 5-10%
""")

print("\n6. RECOMMENDATIONS:")
print("-" * 40)

print("""
To ensure no lookahead bias:

1. ‚úÖ Signals should use only data available at bar close
2. ‚úÖ Entry should be at NEXT bar's open (not signal bar close)
3. ‚úÖ Stops/targets should account for gaps and slippage
4. ‚úÖ Exit at bar close when stop/target touched (not exact price)
5. ‚úÖ Add realistic slippage model (especially for 8+ trades/day)
6. ‚úÖ Verify signal generation doesn't use future data

The current Sharpe of 12.81 likely overstates realistic performance by 20-40%.
A more realistic Sharpe might be 8-10 with proper execution modeling.
