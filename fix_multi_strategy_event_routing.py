Fix for multi-strategy event routing issues.

The architecture uses two communication patterns:
1. Internal (Direct Event Bus) - for parent-child communication within a container hierarchy
2. External (Event Router) - for communication between sibling containers

Current container structure:
BacktestContainer (root)
├── DataContainer
├── IndicatorContainer  
├── ClassifierContainer
│   └── RiskContainer
│       └── PortfolioContainer
│           └── StrategyContainer
└── ExecutionContainer

Proper event flow:
1. Data → (external) → Indicators: BAR events
2. Data → (external) → Strategy: BAR events  
3. Indicators → (external) → Strategy: INDICATOR events
4. Strategy → (internal) → Portfolio: SIGNAL events
5. Portfolio → (internal) → Risk: SIGNAL events (aggregated)
6. Risk → (internal) → Classifier: SIGNAL events (risk-adjusted)
7. Classifier → (external) → Execution: ORDER events
8. Execution → (external) → Classifier: FILL events
9. Classifier → (internal) → Risk → Portfolio: FILL events (cascaded down)

Multi-Strategy Event Routing Fix Plan:
=====================================

1. Strategy publishes SIGNAL internally to Portfolio parent
2. Portfolio aggregates signals, forwards internally to Risk parent  
3. Risk applies risk rules, forwards orders internally to Classifier parent
4. Classifier publishes ORDER externally to Execution (sibling)
5. Execution publishes FILL externally to Classifier (sibling)
6. Classifier forwards FILL internally down to Risk→Portfolio

This eliminates circular dependencies by:
- Using internal communication for the nested hierarchy
- Using external communication only between siblings
- Having Classifier act as the bridge between internal and external events
