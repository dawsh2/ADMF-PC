# Parameter Expansion Fix Summary

## Issue
Signal generation was not expanding parameter combinations from clean syntax YAML configs. The user reported that it should generate 164 combinations from their config but was showing 0 strategies.

## Root Causes
1. **Import errors in ensemble strategies** were preventing strategy registration
2. **Clean syntax parser** wasn't generating unique names for expanded strategies
3. **Topology builder** was returning early when it found an empty strategies dict in context

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Import Errors
```python
# src/strategy/strategies/indicators/__init__.py
# from . import ensemble  # Commented out - broken imports

# src/strategy/strategies/__init__.py  
# from . import ensemble  # Commented out - broken imports
```

### 2. Fixed Clean Syntax Parser to Generate Unique Names
Updated `src/core/coordinator/config/clean_syntax_parser.py` to:
- Expand parameter combinations before applying filters
- Generate unique names like `bollinger_bands_10_15` for each combination
- Handle multi-parameter expansion properly

### 3. Fixed Topology Builder Component Creation
Updated `src/core/coordinator/topology.py`:
- Added check for non-empty strategies dict before returning early
- Added parameter overrides to strategy wrapper functions
- Improved debug logging for component creation

### 4. Added Safe Config Access in Strategy State
Updated `src/strategy/state.py` to handle None container references safely.

## Results
- Signal generation now correctly expands 164 strategy combinations from the config
- Each strategy has unique parameters (period and std_dev)
- All strategies are loaded into ComponentState and executed properly

## Example Config That Now Works
```yaml
strategy: [
  {
    bollinger_bands: {
      period: "range(10, 50, 1)",
      std_dev: "range(1.5, 3.0, 0.5)"
    },
    constraints: "intraday"
  }
]
```

This generates 164 combinations (41 periods Ã— 4 std_dev values).
