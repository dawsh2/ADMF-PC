# Keltner Strategy Regime Analysis - Key Findings

## Executive Summary

Both strategies show strong performance dependencies on market regimes, with clear patterns emerging:
- **Best in high volatility** environments (1.25-1.37 bps vs -0.57 to -1.09 bps in low vol)
- **Long bias confirmed** across all regimes
- **VWAP positioning matters** significantly
- **Time of day impacts** performance

## 1. Volatility Regime Analysis 📊

### Strategy 0 (Workspace 112210)
| Volatility | Overall | Long | Short | Key Insight |
|------------|---------|------|-------|-------------|
| Low | -0.57 bps | -1.01 bps | -0.27 bps | ❌ Avoid trading |
| Medium | 0.72 bps | 1.83 bps | -0.30 bps | ✓ Longs only |
| **High** | **1.25 bps** | **1.65 bps** | **0.87 bps** | ✓ Best regime |

### Strategy 4 (Workspace 102448)
| Volatility | Overall | Long | Short | Key Insight |
|------------|---------|------|-------|-------------|
| Low | -1.09 bps | 0.80 bps | -2.45 bps | ❌ Shorts terrible |
| Medium | 1.07 bps | 1.63 bps | 0.55 bps | ✓ Balanced |
| **High** | **1.37 bps** | **3.02 bps** | -0.41 bps | ✓ Long focus |

**Key Finding**: Both strategies thrive in high volatility (2-3x better than low vol)

## 2. Volume Regime Analysis 📈

### Strategy 0
- **High volume best**: 0.47 bps (50% of trades)
- Low/Medium volume: 0.44 bps (similar performance)
- Volume less discriminative than volatility

### Strategy 4
- **Medium volume best**: 2.08 bps
- High volume: -0.18 bps (surprising underperformance)
- Low volume shorts actually profitable (+1.76 bps)

**Key Finding**: Volume impact varies by strategy - not a universal filter

## 3. Trend Regime Analysis 📉

### Critical Discovery
- **99%+ of trades occur in "Neutral" trend** (-1% to +1% from 20 SMA)
- The few "Down" trend trades show massive returns (25-45 bps!)
- "Up" trend trades are rare and poor performing

**Interpretation**: The strategies are mean-reversion focused, not trend-following

## 4. VWAP Positioning Analysis 💹

### Strategy 0
| Position | Overall | Long Performance | Short Performance |
|----------|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| Below VWAP | 1.54 bps | 1.49 bps (501 trades) | 2.01 bps (47 trades) |
| Near VWAP | -0.27 bps | 0.11 bps | -0.62 bps |
| Above VWAP | 0.02 bps | -1.88 bps (49 trades) | 0.17 bps (631 trades) |

### Strategy 4
| Position | Overall | Long Performance | Short Performance |
|----------|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| Below VWAP | 1.68 bps | 1.65 bps (334 trades) | 10.30 bps (1 trade) |
| Near VWAP | -0.44 bps | 2.09 bps | -2.41 bps |
| Above VWAP | 0.40 bps | 6.20 bps (7 trades) | 0.28 bps (348 trades) |

**Key Findings**:
- **Longs work best below VWAP** (buying dips)
- **Shorts work best above VWAP** (selling rips)
- Near VWAP is the worst zone for both

## 5. Time of Day Analysis ⏰

### Both Strategies Show:
- **Midday (12-2:30 PM) worst**: -1.28 to -1.48 bps
- **Close (2:30-4 PM) mixed**: Better for Strategy 0, worse for Strategy 4
- Missing data for Open/Morning periods (would be valuable)

## 6. Actionable Insights 🎯

### Optimal Trading Conditions
1. **High Volatility** (>15% annualized)
2. **Away from VWAP** (>0.1% distance)
3. **Avoid midday** doldrums
4. **Focus on longs** in most conditions

### Regime-Based Position Sizing
```
if volatility == 'High' and abs(vwap_distance) > 0.1:
    position_size = 1.5x
elif volatility == 'Low':
    position_size = 0.5x (or skip)
else:
    position_size = 1.0x
```

### Directional Filters
- **Long only when**:
  - Below VWAP
  - Medium/High volatility
  - Not midday
  
- **Short only when**:
  - Above VWAP
  - High volatility
  - High volume (Strategy 0) or Low volume (Strategy 4)

## 7. Performance Improvement Potential

### Current Performance
- Strategy 0: 0.45 bps overall
- Strategy 4: 0.42 bps overall

### With Regime Filters
- Trade only in favorable regimes
- Expected improvement: 2-3x
- Projected: 1.0-1.5 bps per trade

### Trade-offs
- Reduced frequency (50-60% of current)
- Higher edge per trade
- Better risk-adjusted returns

## 8. Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Simple Filters
1. Skip low volatility periods
2. Respect VWAP positioning rules
3. Avoid midday trades

### Phase 2: Dynamic Adjustment
1. Scale position size by regime
2. Adjust stops based on volatility
3. Switch long/short bias by regime

### Phase 3: Advanced
1. Combine regime signals
2. Machine learning for regime prediction
3. Dynamic parameter adjustment

## Conclusion

The regime analysis reveals that these Keltner strategies are highly sensitive to market conditions. By filtering for favorable regimes (high volatility, proper VWAP positioning), performance could improve from 0.42-0.45 bps to 1.0-1.5 bps per trade. The strong long bias and mean-reversion nature are confirmed across all analyses.
