## Key Observations

1. **Signal Generation**: The momentum strategy generated 5 signals during the 50-bar period, but risk management only allowed one position due to position limits.

2. **Proper Event Flow**: 
   - Data → Indicators → Strategy → Risk → Execution
   - No incorrect routing of SIGNAL events to PortfolioContainer
   - FILL events properly routed via reverse pipeline

3. **Position Management**: 
   - Correctly tracked position quantity (7 shares)
   - Properly closed position at END_OF_DATA using current market price
   - Cash flow calculations were accurate

4. **No Errors**: Unlike the multi-strategy configuration, this single-strategy setup showed no architectural issues or incorrect event routing.

## Conclusion
The SPY momentum backtest executed correctly with proper:
- Event routing through the pipeline
- Position tracking and management
- Cash flow calculations
- END_OF_DATA handling

The small loss (-$19.42) is reasonable given the short 50-bar test period and reflects realistic trading costs (slippage and commissions).
