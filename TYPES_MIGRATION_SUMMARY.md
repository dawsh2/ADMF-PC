# Types Migration Summary

## What Was Done

I've successfully migrated your types from a centralized `src/core/types/` directory to module-local `types.py` files, following the principle that each module should own its types.

### 1. **Decimal Operations** → `src/execution/calc.py`
- Moved all decimal utilities to execution module where trading calculations happen
- Created `src/execution/calc.py` with all decimal operations
- Named it `calc.py` to be specific about its purpose (avoiding the `utils.py` dumping ground anti-pattern)

### 2. **Trading Types** → `src/execution/types.py`
- Moved Order, Fill, Position, Bar to execution module
- Added trading time utilities (market hours, next market open, etc.)
- These are used for order management and execution

### 3. **Signal Types** → `src/strategy/types.py`
- Created Signal and StrategyConfig types
- These belong to the strategy module that generates them

### 4. **Risk Types** → `src/risk/types.py` (NEW)
- Created RiskLimit, RiskCheck, PortfolioRisk, PositionRisk
- RiskLimitType and RiskAction enums
- RiskConfig for risk management configuration
- These were missing and are essential for the risk module

### 5. **Workflow Types** → `src/core/coordinator/types.py`
- Moved WorkflowType, WorkflowPhase, ExecutionContext, etc.
- These are coordinator-specific types for workflow management

### 6. **Component Types** → `src/core/components/types.py` (NEW)
- Created minimal types needed by component protocols
- ComponentType enum for component classification
- ComponentMetadata for component information
- PositionPayload for Portfolio protocol
- HealthStatus for Monitorable protocol

### 7. **Event Types** → `src/core/events/types.py` (in refactor.md)
- Already included in the events refactor
- Added time utilities for event timestamps
- Functions like parse_event_time, event_age, is_event_stale

### 8. **Duck Types** → Deleted
- These are unnecessary with your Protocol + Composition approach
- Protocols provide better type safety and flexibility

## Final Step Required

Run this command to delete the old types directory:
```bash
rm -rf /Users/daws/ADMF-PC/src/core/types
```

Or run the Python script I created:
```bash
python3 /Users/daws/ADMF-PC/delete_types.py
```

## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Better Cohesion** - Types live with the code that uses them
2. **Clearer Dependencies** - Import paths show true module relationships
3. **Easier Refactoring** - Move a module and its types go with it
4. **No Central Dumping Ground** - Each module owns its domain

## Import Changes Needed

Old imports:
```python
from src.core.types import Order, Fill, Signal
from src.core.types.decimal import ensure_decimal
```

New imports:
```python
from src.execution.types import Order, Fill
from src.strategy.types import Signal
from src.execution.calc import ensure_decimal
```

This aligns perfectly with your Protocol + Composition architecture!
