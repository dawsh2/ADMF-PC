- **Optimal Filter Reduction**: 98.6% (Master Regime Filter)

### 2. Filter Type Performance

| Filter Type | Signal Reduction | RPT (bps) | Win Rate | Trades | Annual Return |
|------------|------------------|-----------|----------|---------|---------------|
| Master Regime (Vol+VWAP+Time) | 98.6% | 4.09 | 60.9% | 23 | 0.9% |
| RSI/Volume Combination | 91.3% | 0.76 | 59.6% | 151 | 1.2% |

### 3. Long vs Short Performance
- **Master Regime Filter**: Strong long bias (7.10 vs 1.77 bps)
- **RSI/Volume Filter**: Long-only candidate (2.51 vs -0.87 bps)
- **Recommendation**: Consider long-only implementation for top filters

### 4. Trading Frequency vs Edge Trade-off
- **High Edge/Low Frequency**: Master Regime (4.09 bps, 0.09 trades/day)
- **Balanced**: RSI/Volume (0.76 bps, 0.6 trades/day)
- **High Frequency/Lower Edge**: Minimal RSI (0.68 bps, 5.7 trades/day)

## Implementation Recommendations

### For Maximum Edge (Conservative)
- Use Master Regime Filter (47 signals)
- Expected: 4.09 bps/trade
- ~23 trades annually
- Best for patient capital with low capacity constraints

### For Balanced Approach
- Use RSI/Volume Combination (303 signals)
- Expected: 0.76 bps/trade
- ~151 trades annually (0.6/day)
- Annual return: ~1.2%

### For Higher Frequency
- Use Minimal RSI Filter (2,826 signals)
- Expected: 0.68 bps/trade
- ~1,429 trades annually (5.7/day)
- Annual return: ~9.7%

## Filter Descriptions

1. **Master Regime Filter**: Combines volatility regime (ATR > threshold), VWAP positioning, and time-of-day exclusions
2. **RSI/Volume Combination**: RSI conditions with volume confirmation
3. **Minimal RSI Filter**: Light RSI-based filtering only
4. **Volatility Filter**: ATR-based regime filtering
5. **Time Filter**: Excludes specific trading hours
6. **Directional Filter**: Long/short specific conditions

## Metadata Enhancement Status
✅ Successfully created metadata enhancement tool that adds filter information to strategies
❌ Not yet integrated into core system - requires manual enhancement after runs

## Next Steps
1. Integrate filter metadata enhancer into core compilation process
2. Test stop loss implementation with full OHLC data
3. Implement production trading for selected filter combination
4. Monitor real-time performance vs backtest
