  - MarketRegime enum (TRENDING, RANGING, VOLATILE, UNKNOWN)
  - RegimeChangeEvent for cross-container communication
  - ClassificationFeatures for ML feature extraction
  - ClassifierConfig for flexible configuration
  - RegimeState for historical tracking

### 2. Base Classifier Framework (`src/strategy/classifiers/classifier.py`)

- **Architecture**: Protocol + Composition pattern for classifiers
- **Features**:
  - ClassifierProtocol defining interface
  - BaseClassifier abstract implementation
  - Feature extraction (returns, volatility, momentum, volume)
  - State management and regime history
  - DummyClassifier for testing

### 3. Pattern Classifier (`src/strategy/classifiers/pattern_classifier.py`)
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Architecture**: Rule-based pattern recognition
- **Features**:
  - ATR-based volatility detection
  - Linear regression trend analysis
  - Trend consistency measurement
  - Multi-threshold classification logic
  - Technical indicator integration (SMA, ATR)

### 4. Classifier Container (`src/strategy/classifiers/classifier_container.py`)
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Architecture**: Event-isolated container for regime detection
- **Features**:
  - Isolated event bus per container
  - Regime change event emission
  - Lifecycle management (reset, cleanup)
  - Factory methods for different configurations
  - State tracking and monitoring

## ✅ Core Functionality Validated

### Pattern-Based Classification
- **Trending Markets**: Detects strong directional movement with trend consistency > 60%
- **Ranging Markets**: Identifies sideways movement with low trend strength
- **Volatile Markets**: Recognizes high normalized volatility (ATR/Price > threshold)
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Configurable sensitivity for different market conditions

### Event-Driven Architecture
- **Container Isolation**: Each classifier has isolated event bus
- **Regime Change Events**: Automatic emission when regimes transition
- **Cross-Container Communication**: Proper event routing without interference
- **Subscriber Management**: Direct callbacks and event bus subscriptions

### Technical Implementation
- **Feature Extraction**: Returns, volatility, momentum, volume ratios
- **Confidence Scoring**: Dynamic confidence based on classification clarity
- **State Management**: Regime history, transition tracking, metrics
- **Memory Management**: Rolling windows, bounded history storage

- **Logging System**: Integrated with ContainerLogger

### Configuration Options
```python
# Conservative classification
config = ClassifierConfig(
    classifier_type="pattern",
    min_confidence=0.8,
    volatility_threshold=0.015,
    trend_threshold=0.6
)

# Sensitive classification  
config = ClassifierConfig(
    classifier_type="pattern",
    min_confidence=0.6,
    volatility_threshold=0.025,
    trend_threshold=0.4
)
```
