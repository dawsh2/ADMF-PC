# Bollinger RSI Divergence - EXACT Implementation Summary

## The Profitable Pattern (from backtest analysis)
- **494 trades** over test period
- **71.9% win rate**
- **11.82% net return** (after 1bp costs)
- **~12 bar average holding period**

## Implementation Details

### Entry Logic
1. **Track extremes**: When price closes outside Bollinger Bands, record the low/high and RSI
2. **Find divergence**: When price is outside bands again:
   - Look back up to 20 bars for previous extremes
   - For LONG: Current low < previous low AND current RSI > previous RSI + 5
   - For SHORT: Current high > previous high AND current RSI < previous RSI - 5
3. **Wait for confirmation**: After divergence found, wait up to 10 bars for price to close back inside bands
4. **Enter on confirmation**: Enter position when price closes inside bands

### Exit Logic
- **Primary exit**: When price reaches middle band (20 SMA)
- **Secondary exit**: After 50 bars maximum
- **No stop loss** in the profitable pattern

### Critical Implementation Points
1. **State management**: Must track pattern across multiple bars
2. **No duplicate entries**: Once in a position, don't take new signals until exit
3. **Exact parameters**:
   - Bollinger Bands: 20 period, 2.0 std dev
   - RSI: 14 period
   - Divergence threshold: 5 points
   - Lookback: 20 bars
   - Confirmation window: 10 bars
   - Max hold: 50 bars

### Why Other Implementations Failed
1. **bollinger_rsi_confirmed**: No multi-bar tracking, took 1,245 trades (2.5x too many)
2. **bollinger_rsi_exact/tracker**: Too restrictive, only 1 signal
3. **bollinger_rsi_dependent**: Wrong exit logic, held 452 bars average (should be 12)

### The Solution
The `BollingerRSIDivergenceExact` feature implements the exact state machine:
- `scanning` → `waiting_confirmation` → `in_position` → `scanning`
- Tracks extremes in dictionaries with bar cleanup
- Enforces single position at a time
- Uses exact exit conditions

This matches the profitable backtest pattern exactly.
