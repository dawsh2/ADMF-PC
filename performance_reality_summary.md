# Performance Reality Check: What Happened to the >1 bps Results?

## The Short Answer
We DID find strategies with >1 bps performance, but they don't meet your 2-3 trades/day requirement:
- **4.09 bps/trade**: Master Regime Filter - only 0.09 trades/day (23 trades total)
- **0.76 bps/trade**: RSI/Volume Filter - only 0.60 trades/day (151 trades total)

## Strategies Meeting BOTH Requirements (>2 trades/day AND best returns)
1. **Volatility Filter (2,826 signals)**
   - 0.68 bps/trade
   - 5.7 trades/day ✓
   - 9.7% annual return

2. **Minimal Filters (3,261 signals)**
   - 0.55 bps/trade  
   - 6.5 trades/day ✓
   - 9.0% annual return

## Why the Discrepancy?
1. **Filter Effectiveness Trade-off**
   - Heavy filters (>90% reduction) dramatically improve per-trade returns
   - BUT they also eliminate most trading opportunities
   - Result: Great returns, terrible frequency

2. **The Base Strategy Reality**
   - Keltner Bands on 5-min bars has inherent edge of only ~0.4-0.5 bps
   - No amount of filtering can create edge that isn't there
   - Heavy filtering just concentrates the existing small edge

3. **Analysis Method Differences**
   - Filter group analysis: Averaged across 11 strategies per group
   - Individual analysis: Looked at specific strategies with OHLC data
   - Reality: 0.45-0.69 bps/trade is the true performance range

## Updated Config Impact
I've added enhanced regime filters to your config that target:
- High volatility environments (1.2-1.5x normal)
- Proper VWAP positioning (below for longs, above for shorts)
- Time-of-day exclusions (avoid 12:00-14:30 dead zone)
- Volume confirmations

Expected results from new filters:
- Best case: 1.0-1.5 bps/trade with 1-2 trades/day
- Realistic: 0.6-0.8 bps/trade with 3-5 trades/day
- Baseline: 0.4-0.5 bps/trade with 5-7 trades/day

## The Bottom Line
For strategies meeting your 2-3+ trades/day requirement:
- Best available: 0.68 bps/trade (5.7 trades/day)
- This is 50% better than unfiltered baseline
- Annual return: ~10% before costs, ~5-7% after costs

The >1 bps strategies exist but trade too infrequently for practical implementation.
