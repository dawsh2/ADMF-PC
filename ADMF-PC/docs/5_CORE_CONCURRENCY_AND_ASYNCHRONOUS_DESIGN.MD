# ADMF Core: Concurrency, Parallelism, and Asynchronous Design

## 1. Overview

The ADMF-Trader system is designed to operate efficiently in various execution contexts, from single-threaded backtests to multi-threaded/multi-process optimizations and potentially I/O-bound live trading scenarios. This document outlines the core strategies and architectural patterns for managing concurrency, thread safety, parallel execution primitives, and asynchronous processing within the system. The goal is to ensure data integrity, responsiveness, and optimal resource utilization.

## 2. Core Thread Safety Principles & Patterns

Ensuring thread safety is paramount when shared resources or state are accessed by multiple threads, common in optimization and live trading modes.

### 2.1. Basic Locking

* **`threading.RLock`**: Reentrant locks are the primary mechanism for protecting critical sections and shared mutable state within components.
    * The `ComponentBase` example in `docs/core/concurrency/THREAD_SAFETY.md` shows an `_lock = threading.RLock()` for protecting its internal state flags (`initialized`, `running`).
    * The `EventBus` in `src/core/event_bus.py` also utilizes `threading.RLock` to protect its subscriber lists during publish/subscribe operations.

### 2.2. Idealized Thread-Safe Collections

While not yet fully implemented as generic utilities in `src/core`, the design envisions dedicated thread-safe collection classes (`ThreadSafeDict`, `ThreadSafeList`, `ThreadSafeSet`). These would encapsulate locking behavior for common collection operations, simplifying their use in components.

**Conceptual Structure (`ThreadSafeDict` example from `THREAD_SAFETY.md`):**
```python
import threading
from typing import Dict, TypeVar, Generic, Iterator, Any, Optional

K = TypeVar('K')
V = TypeVar('V')

class ThreadSafeDict(Generic[K, V]):
    def __init__(self):
        self._dict: Dict[K, V] = {}
        self._lock = threading.RLock() # Each instance has its own lock

    def __getitem__(self, key: K) -> V:
        with self._lock:
            return self._dict[key]

    def __setitem__(self, key: K, value: V) -> None:
        with self._lock:
            self._dict[key] = value
    # ... other methods (pop, clear, update, items, etc.) would also be wrapped with self._lock ...
```

### 2.3. Thread-Safe Component Design Guidelines

* Components managing shared state that can be accessed concurrently must implement internal locking.
* Critical sections should be minimized to reduce contention.
* Favor thread-safe collections or design components to minimize shared mutable state where possible.

### 2.4. Atomic Operations

For simple state updates (e.g., counters, flags), using Python's atomic operations (like for int assignment, list.append) or specialized atomic classes (like AtomicCounter from the design) can be more efficient than explicit locks. AtomicCounter would use an internal lock for its operations.

### 2.5. Thread-Safe Lazy Initialization

A double-checked locking pattern or a similar mechanism should be used for lazy initialization of shared resources in a thread-safe manner.

```python
class LazyInitializer:
    def __init__(self, initializer):
        self._initializer = initializer
        self._value = None
        self._initialized = False
        self._lock = threading.RLock()

    @property
    def value(self):
        if not self._initialized:
            with self._lock: # Outer lock
                if not self._initialized: # Double check
                    self._value = self._initializer()
                    self._initialized = True
        return self._value
```

### 2.6. Thread Safety Best Practices

* **Lock Ordering**: Establish and adhere to a global order for acquiring multiple locks to prevent deadlocks.
* **Minimize Lock Scope**: Hold locks for the shortest possible duration.
* **Lock Granularity**: Choose appropriate lock granularity (coarse vs. fine-grained) based on contention and complexity.
* **Immutable Objects**: Use immutable objects for shared data where possible to eliminate the need for locks.
* **Thread-Local Storage**: Use threading.local() for data that should be specific to each thread.

## 3. Context-Aware Thread Safety [Idealized Design]
To optimize performance in single-threaded scenarios (like basic backtesting) while ensuring safety in multi-threaded ones (optimization, live trading), a context-aware thread safety mechanism is designed.

3.1. Motivation

Applying full thread-safety primitives (locks, thread-safe collections) incurs overhead. This overhead is unnecessary in single-threaded execution modes. Context-aware thread safety allows the system to adapt its synchronization behavior based on the current execution environment.

3.2. ExecutionContext for Threading

An ExecutionContext class (distinct from EventContext which is for event flow) would define the current threading model (e.g., SINGLE_THREADED, MULTI_THREADED).
The Bootstrap system would establish the appropriate ExecutionContext based on the RunMode.
Components can query this context to determine if full thread-safety measures are required.
Your src/core/bootstrap.py defines RunMode and SystemContext. SystemContext.run_mode can be used to infer the threading requirements, but a more explicit ThreadingMode within SystemContext or a dedicated ExecutionContext would align closer with this design.

### 3.3. ThreadSafetyFactory

* A factory responsible for creating synchronization primitives (locks, collections) appropriate for the current ExecutionContext's threading mode.
* If in SINGLE_THREADED mode, it might return standard Python collections and a DummyLock.
* If in MULTI_THREADED mode, it returns thread-safe collections (like the idealized ThreadSafeDict) and real threading.RLock instances.

### 3.4. DummyLock

A no-operation lock implementation for single-threaded contexts to avoid locking overhead.

```python
class DummyLock:
    def __enter__(self): return self
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb): pass
    def acquire(self, blocking=True, timeout=-1): return True
    def release(self): pass
```

### 3.5. Context-Aware Collections

Collections that internally use the ThreadSafetyFactory or directly check the ExecutionContext to decide whether to apply locking for their operations.

### 3.6. Thread Detection Utility

A utility (ThreadDetector) can be used for runtime checks of thread activity if the AUTO_DETECT threading mode is implemented.

## 4. Parallel Execution Primitives [Conceptual from docs/core/concurrency/PARALLEL_EXECUTION.md]
While full parallel execution frameworks for optimization or backtesting are higher-level, the Core module might provide or rely on fundamental primitives that enable such parallelism.

Distinction between Thread-Based and Process-Based Parallelism:
Thread-Based (concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor): Useful for I/O-bound tasks or when tasks require access to shared memory within the same process. Subject to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) for CPU-bound tasks.
Process-Based (multiprocessing.Pool, concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor): Suitable for CPU-bound tasks as each process gets its own Python interpreter and memory space, bypassing the GIL. Requires inter-process communication (IPC) for data sharing if needed (e.g., via queues, pipes, or shared memory). This offers stronger isolation.
Core TaskQueue Design: A generic, thread-safe queue (like queue.Queue or an enhanced version) for distributing units of work to a pool of worker threads or processes.
Resource Management for Parallelism (ResourceManager concept): A utility to determine an optimal number of workers (threads/processes) based on available system resources (CPU cores, memory). This helps prevent oversubscription and system overload.
The ResourceManager from PARALLEL_EXECUTION.md details logic for this.
Process Isolation Utilities: Functions to run operations in truly isolated processes, capturing results or exceptions, important for robust parallel optimization where one failing trial shouldn't crash the entire system.
5. Asynchronous Architecture [Idealized Design]
For scenarios demanding high I/O concurrency with lower overhead than threads, especially in live trading (e.g., managing multiple network connections for data feeds and broker APIs), an async/await based architecture is envisioned.

5.1. Motivation

Efficiently handle many concurrent I/O-bound operations (network requests, file I/O).
Maintain UI responsiveness in applications with GUIs.
Reduce resource consumption compared to a heavily threaded model for I/O tasks.
5.2. AsyncComponentBase

An abstract base class for components designed to work within an asyncio event loop. Lifecycle methods (initialize, start, stop, teardown) would be async methods.

Python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
import asyncio

class AsyncComponentBase(ABC): # Conceptual
    async def initialize(self, context: Any) -> None: pass
    async def start(self) -> None: pass
    async def stop(self) -> None: pass
    # ...
5.3. AsyncEventBus

An EventBus implementation supporting async handlers. It would use asyncio.Queue for event buffering and asyncio.Lock or asyncio.Condition for synchronization within the event loop.

It should be able to run synchronous handlers in an executor to avoid blocking the event loop.
5.4. Event Loop Management

Backtesting Mode: Might run an async method to completion using asyncio.run() or manage a simple loop.
Live Trading Mode: Would typically have a main asyncio event loop running loop.run_forever().
Proper signal handling (SIGINT, SIGTERM) for graceful shutdown of the async loop.
5.5. Dual-Mode Components & Async/Sync Bridge

Dual-Mode: Components could be designed to operate in both synchronous and asynchronous contexts, perhaps by having *_async versions of their methods or by internally managing how they interact with an event loop if present.
Async/Sync Bridge: Utilities or adapter classes to allow synchronous code to call asynchronous code (e.g., by running it in an event loop until completion) and for asynchronous code to safely run synchronous, blocking tasks in an executor thread pool (loop.run_in_executor).
5.6. Async-Safe Primitives & Coordination

Use asyncio.Lock, asyncio.Queue, asyncio.Event, asyncio.Condition for synchronization within asyncio tasks and coroutines.
An AsyncEventBarrier or similar for coordinating multiple asyncio tasks.
5.7. Guidelines for Async Implementation

Use async/await consistently for I/O-bound operations within the async part of the system.
Handle asyncio.CancelledError for graceful task cancellation.
Avoid blocking calls within coroutines; use await loop.run_in_executor() for CPU-bound or blocking synchronous code.
Manage asyncio tasks properly (e.g., ensure they are awaited or gathered).
The current src/core/ is primarily synchronous. The full asynchronous architecture is a significant future implementation area.

6. Summary of Concurrency Best Practices
Choose the Right Tool: Use threads for I/O-bound or parallel tasks needing shared memory (with GIL awareness). Use processes for CPU-bound tasks requiring true parallelism and isolation. Use asyncio for high-volume I/O-bound concurrency with lower overhead than many threads.
State Management: Minimize shared mutable state. If state must be shared, protect it with appropriate synchronization primitives (locks, async locks, thread-safe collections).
Isolation: Leverage scoped containers and process-based parallelism for strong state isolation between independent tasks like optimization trials.
Context Awareness: Design components or use factories that can adapt their concurrency mechanisms (or lack thereof) to the execution context (single-threaded, multi-threaded, async).
Graceful Shutdown: Ensure all threads, processes, and async tasks can be shut down gracefully.
This consolidated document provides a blueprint for managing concurrency, parallelism, and asynchronous operations within ADMF-Trader, aiming for a balance of performance, safety, and architectural clarity.
