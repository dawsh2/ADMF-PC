# Complete Fix Summary - Ready for New Backtest

## All Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ OHLC Data in Signals
**File**: `src/strategy/strategies/indicators/volatility.py`
- Added open, high, low, close to Bollinger Bands metadata
- Risk manager can now check actual high/low for accurate exits

### 2. ✅ Signal Metadata Storage
**File**: `src/core/events/observers/streaming_multi_strategy_tracer.py`
- Fixed to pass signal's metadata (with OHLC) instead of strategy config
- Line 214: `signal_metadata = payload.get('metadata', {})`

### 3. ✅ Metadata as Dict (Not JSON String)
**File**: `src/core/events/storage/streaming_sparse_storage.py`
- Removed JSON serialization of metadata
- Keeps metadata as dict for easy access to OHLC data
- Line 56: `result['metadata'] = self.metadata`

### 4. ✅ Strategy ID in Position Events
**File**: `src/core/events/storage/dense_event_storage.py`
- Extracts strategy_id as a separate column
- Also extracts exit_type, entry_price, exit_price
- Exit memory can now find strategy_id

### 5. ✅ Risk Manager OHLC Usage
**File**: `src/risk/strategy_risk_manager.py`
- Extracts OHLC from signal metadata
- Uses LOW price to check stop loss (for longs)
- Uses HIGH price to check take profit (for longs)

### 6. ✅ Exit Memory (Previously Fixed)
**File**: `src/portfolio/state.py`
- Passes strategy_id when creating positions
- Enables exit memory to prevent re-entries

## What These Fixes Solve

1. **Accurate Exit Prices**: Stop losses and take profits checked against actual high/low
2. **No More +0.075% Stop Loss Exits**: Should exit at -0.075% as expected
3. **Exit Memory Can Work**: strategy_id properly stored and accessible
4. **Easier Data Access**: Metadata stored as dict, not JSON string

## Next Steps

1. **Clear Python cache**:
```bash
./clear_python_cache.sh
```

2. **Run the backtest**:
```bash
python main.py --config config/bollinger/test.yaml
```

3. **Verify the fixes worked**:
```bash
python analyze_latest_results.py
python check_metadata_format.py
```

## Expected Results

After this run, you should see:
- Signals with OHLC data in metadata (as dict, not string)
- Position events with strategy_id column
- Stop losses exiting at losses, not gains
- Exit memory potentially working (fewer immediate re-entries)
- Different trade count (hopefully closer to 416)

## Key Insight

The main issue was that OHLC data wasn't being passed or stored properly, so the risk manager couldn't check if stop losses or take profits were actually hit during each bar. This should now be fixed!
