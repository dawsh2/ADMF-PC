# Swing Pivot Bounce Strategy Analysis

## Issue Summary
The swing_pivot_bounce strategy configuration was created successfully, but when run, it generated 0 signals over 800 bars of data.

## Root Cause
The strategy requires `support_resistance` features which appear to not be available in the standard feature set. The strategy expects features with keys like:
- `support_resistance_20_resistance` 
- `support_resistance_20_support`

However, the feature factory likely doesn't recognize or create these features, causing the strategy to receive None values and thus generate no signals.

## Debug Results
1. **Workspace Analysis** (signal_generation_80a6a1d9):
   - Total bars processed: 799
   - Total signals generated: 0
   - No components registered in metadata

2. **Manual Testing**: 
   - When tested with synthetic data and manually calculated S/R levels, the strategy generates signals correctly
   - The issue is specifically with feature availability in the production system

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Use Standard Features
Modify the strategy to use Bollinger Bands as dynamic support/resistance:
```yaml
feature_config:
  bollinger_bands:
    - period: 20
      std_dev: 2.0
```

### Option 2: Implement Support/Resistance Feature
The support_resistance feature needs to be properly registered in the feature factory. The feature class exists in `src/strategy/components/features/indicators/structure.py` but may not be connected to the factory.

### Option 3: Use Existing Working Strategies
Based on our previous analysis, the most profitable strategy is `bollinger_rsi_simple_signals` which:
- Generates ~700 trades/year
- Has 65.7% win rate
- Returns 3.1% annually with filtering at 1bp costs

## Current Status
- Configuration file created: `/config/indicators/structure/swing_pivot_bounce.yaml`
- Strategy exists and works in isolation
- Feature integration issue prevents signals in production

## Next Steps
1. Either fix the feature registration for support_resistance
2. Or create a variant using standard features like Bollinger Bands
3. Or focus on the proven profitable strategies like bollinger_rsi_simple_signals
