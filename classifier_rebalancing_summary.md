# Classifier Rebalancing Summary

## Problem Analysis

The classifier implementations were producing heavily imbalanced distributions:

1. **multi_timeframe_trend_classifier**: 99.9% in sideways state
2. **volatility_momentum_classifier**: 61.1% in neutral state  
3. **market_regime_classifier**: 57.7% in neutral state
4. **microstructure_classifier**: 87.8% in consolidation state
5. **hidden_markov_classifier**: 64.9% in uncertainty state

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Thresholds Too High**: Market movements rarely exceed 2% in hourly timeframes
2. **Overly Strict Conditions**: Required multiple conditions to be met simultaneously (AND logic)
3. **Default to Neutral States**: Classifiers defaulted to sideways/neutral/consolidation too easily
4. **RSI Thresholds Too Extreme**: Using 65/35 when market rarely reaches these levels

## Changes Implemented

### 1. multi_timeframe_trend_classifier
- **strong_threshold**: 0.02 → 0.01 (2% → 1%)
- **weak_threshold**: 0.005 → 0.002 (0.5% → 0.2%)
- Changed from simple average to weighted average (50% price trend, 30% medium, 20% short)

### 2. volatility_momentum_classifier
- **vol_threshold**: 1.5 → 1.0 (1.5% → 1%)
- **rsi_overbought**: 65 → 60
- **rsi_oversold**: 35 → 40
- Changed from AND to OR logic for momentum detection

### 3. market_regime_classifier
- **trend_threshold**: 0.01 → 0.005 (1% → 0.5%)
- **vol_threshold**: 1.0 → 0.8 (1% → 0.8%)
- Fixed is_trending logic from AND to OR
- Relaxed RSI thresholds from 50 to 48/52

### 4. microstructure_classifier
- **breakout_threshold**: 0.005 → 0.003 (0.5% → 0.3%)
- **consolidation_threshold**: 0.002 → 0.001 (0.2% → 0.1%)
- RSI reversal thresholds: 25/75 → 30/70
- Added nuanced default logic instead of always returning consolidation

### 5. hidden_markov_classifier
- **volume_surge_threshold**: 1.5 → 1.3
- **trend_strength_threshold**: 0.02 → 0.01 (2% → 1%)
- **volatility_threshold**: 1.5 → 1.2 (1.5% → 1.2%)
- Removed default to uncertainty state
- Added fallback logic to assign most likely regime based on signals

## Expected Impact

These changes should result in:

1. **More Balanced Distributions**: Each state should see 15-30% representation instead of 90%+ in one state
2. **Better Signal Diversity**: Strategies will operate across different market regimes
3. **Improved Backtesting**: More realistic regime transitions and coverage
4. **Enhanced Strategy Performance**: Regime-aware strategies will have meaningful regime filters

## Testing Recommendations

1. Run a new backtest with the updated classifiers
2. Monitor the new state distributions using `analyze_classifier_balance.py`
3. Verify that each classifier now produces at least 3 active states
4. Check that no single state exceeds 50% of the total predictions
5. Validate that regime transitions occur at reasonable frequencies

## Future Improvements

1. **Adaptive Thresholds**: Make thresholds adjust based on recent market volatility
2. **Multi-Timeframe Integration**: Use different thresholds for different timeframes
3. **Volume-Weighted Metrics**: Incorporate volume more heavily in regime detection
4. **Machine Learning Enhancement**: Train thresholds on historical regime labels
