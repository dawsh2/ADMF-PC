# Incremental Complexity Guide: From Basic Backtest to Multi-Phase Optimization

## Phase 0: Foundation Validation (Days 1-3)

### Step 1: Core Pipeline Test - Single Component Chain
**Goal**: Validate basic data flow through isolated event buses

```
Market Data → Indicator Hub → Strategy → Backtest Engine
```

**What to build**:
- Single symbol (SPY)
- Single indicator (SMA-20)
- Single strategy (SMA crossover)
- Basic backtest engine
- No risk containers yet

**Event flow to validate**:
```python
# Expected event sequence:
1. Market Data Stream → BAR_EVENT
2. Indicator Hub consumes BAR_EVENT → SMA_EVENT  
3. Strategy consumes SMA_EVENT → SIGNAL_EVENT
4. Backtest Engine consumes SIGNAL_EVENT → executes trade
```

**Key tests**:
- [ ] Events flow correctly through isolated buses
- [ ] Each component receives expected events
- [ ] No event leakage between components
- [ ] Clean component initialization order
- [ ] Proper event bus wiring

**Expected output**: Simple CSV with trades (timestamp, symbol, side, quantity, price)

---

### Step 2: Add Risk Container - Test Signal→Order Transformation
**Goal**: Validate the signal transformation pipeline

```
Market Data → Indicator Hub → Strategy → Risk Container → Backtest Engine
```

**What to add**:
- Basic risk container with simple position sizing
- Event transformation: SIGNAL_EVENT → ORDER_EVENT
- Portfolio state tracking

**New event flow to validate**:
```python
# Enhanced event sequence:
1-3. (Same as Step 1)
4. Strategy generates SIGNAL_EVENT
5. Risk Container consumes SIGNAL_EVENT → ORDER_EVENT
6. Backtest Engine consumes ORDER_EVENT → FILL_EVENT
7. Risk Container consumes FILL_EVENT → updates portfolio state
```

**Key tests**:
- [ ] Signal-to-order transformation works
- [ ] Position sizing applied correctly
- [ ] Portfolio state updates on fills
- [ ] Risk limits enforced (basic)

**Expected output**: Enhanced CSV with position sizes and portfolio state

---

### Step 2.5: Data Splitting & Walk-Forward Foundation
**Goal**: Establish robust data handling and time-series validation from the start

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: This must be implemented early - walk-forward sequencing is nearly impossible to retrofit correctly.

**What to add**:
- Train/validation/test data splitting infrastructure
- Walk-forward window management
- Time-based data leakage prevention
- Rolling window backtest execution
- Out-of-sample validation framework

**Data splitting architecture to build**:
```python
# Time-based splitting (no look-ahead bias):
DataSplitter:
    ├── TrainingWindow: 2020-01-01 to 2022-12-31 (2 years)
    ├── ValidationWindow: 2023-01-01 to 2023-06-30 (6 months)  
    └── TestWindow: 2023-07-01 to 2024-12-31 (1.5 years)

# Walk-forward windows:
WalkForwardManager:
    ├── Window 1: Train[2020-2021] → Test[2022-Q1]
    ├── Window 2: Train[2020-2022-Q1] → Test[2022-Q2]
    ├── Window 3: Train[2020-2022-Q2] → Test[2022-Q3]
    └── Continue rolling windows...
```

**Walk-forward event flows to validate**:
```python
# Walk-forward backtest execution:
1. WalkForwardManager → TRAIN_WINDOW_EVENT, TEST_WINDOW_EVENT
2. DataContainer restricts data to current train window
3. Strategy/Risk containers optimize on train data only
4. TestExecutor runs strategy on test window (no optimization)
5. WindowAdvancer → NEXT_WINDOW_EVENT
6. Repeat for all walk-forward periods
7. Aggregator → WALK_FORWARD_SUMMARY_EVENT
```

**Critical data integrity validations**:
```python
# Ensure no data leakage:
1. Assert: max(train_dates) < min(test_dates) for each window
2. Assert: no overlapping time periods across windows
3. Assert: no future data in indicator calculations
4. Assert: regime detection uses only past data
5. Assert: parameter optimization only uses training data
6. Assert: walk-forward windows maintain chronological order
7. Assert: no test data influences any training decisions
```

**Key tests**:
- [ ] **No look-ahead bias**: Future data never influences past decisions
- [ ] **Training isolation**: Parameters optimized only on training windows
- [ ] **Test purity**: Test data remains truly out-of-sample
- [ ] **Window advancement**: Walk-forward windows progress correctly
- [ ] **Data boundaries**: Clean splits with no contamination
- [ ] **Chronological order**: Time-series integrity maintained
- [ ] **Gap handling**: Configurable gaps between train/test prevent leakage

**Walk-forward configurations to validate**:
- [ ] **Anchored windows**: Fixed start date, extending end date
- [ ] **Rolling windows**: Fixed window size, sliding start/end dates
- [ ] **Expanding windows**: Growing training set, fixed test periods
- [ ] **Seasonal alignment**: Windows respect quarterly/yearly boundaries
- [ ] **Crisis inclusion**: Each window contains both normal and stress periods

**Expected outputs**:
- Walk-forward performance matrix (strategy × time window)
- Out-of-sample degradation analysis
- Data leakage test results (must show zero leakage)
- Window transition logging with timestamp verification
- Training vs test performance comparison

**Why this is critical early on**:
1. **Architecture dependency**: Event flows must respect time boundaries from day 1
2. **Container design**: Data containers need window-aware data filtering
3. **Strategy isolation**: Strategies must never see future data during training
4. **Result validity**: All subsequent complexity builds on this foundation
5. **Debugging**: Time leakage bugs are exponentially harder to find later
6. **Institutional credibility**: Professional systems require bulletproof validation

    container_b = create_container("test_b")
    
    # Events in A should not affect B
    container_a.publish_event("TEST_EVENT")
    assert not container_b.received_events("TEST_EVENT")
    
    # Verify independent state
    assert container_a.state != container_b.state
```

### Performance Validation
```python

def test_signal_replay_performance():
    full_backtest_time = run_full_backtest()
    signal_replay_time = run_signal_replay() 
    
    speedup = full_backtest_time / signal_replay_time
    assert speedup > 10  # Should be much faster

### Container Issues:
- **Improper nesting**: Child containers not inheriting parent context
- **Resource conflicts**: Shared resources between containers
- **State pollution**: Container state affecting others
- **Cleanup problems**: Containers not disposing properly

### Signal Replay Issues:
- **Metadata loss**: Missing context in captured signals
- **Timing problems**: Signal ordering not preserved
- **Parameter mismatches**: Replay using wrong parameters
- **Performance degradation**: Replay not achieving expected speedup

## Development Tips

1. **Start with extensive logging** - Log every event, every state change
2. **Build comprehensive tests** - Test isolation, event flow, performance
3. **Use small datasets initially** - Faster iteration during development
4. **Validate at each step** - Don't proceed until current step works perfectly
5. **Keep configs simple** - Start with minimal parameter spaces
6. **Monitor resource usage** - Watch memory/CPU during development
7. **Document assumptions** - Write down what each component expects
8. **Test edge cases** - Empty signals, regime changes, container failures

This incremental approach will give you confidence at each stage and help you catch issues early before they compound in the complex multi-phase system.

## Complexity Maximization Testing Framework

### Performance Benchmarks
```python
class ComplexityBenchmarks:
    def test_symbol_scaling(self):
        """Test system performance with increasing symbol count"""
        for symbol_count in [10, 100, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000]:
