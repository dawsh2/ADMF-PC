# Memory Management Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the inter-phase memory management system for ADMF-PC, focusing on container lifecycle-based writing and event tracing as the unified metrics system.

## Key Implementation Changes

### 1. Sequencer Updates (`src/core/coordinator_refactor/sequencer.py`)

**Added Methods:**
- `_collect_phase_results()`: Collects results from all portfolio containers
- `_save_results_to_disk()`: Saves results to disk with proper directory structure
- `_create_summary()`: Creates minimal summary for memory efficiency
- `_aggregate_portfolio_metrics()`: Aggregates metrics from multiple portfolios

**Modified Methods:**
- `execute_sequence()`: Now handles results collection and storage based on phase config
  - Checks `results_storage` configuration (memory/disk)
  - Saves to disk when configured, keeping only summary in memory
  - Passes metadata (workflow_id, phase_name) for proper file organization

### 2. Container Updates (`src/core/containers/container.py`)

**Added Methods:**
- `_save_results_before_cleanup()`: Saves results during container destruction
- `_setup_event_tracing_metrics()`: Sets up event tracing as the metrics system for portfolio containers

**Modified Methods:**
- `cleanup()`: Now checks for disk storage and saves results before cleanup
- `__init__()`: Portfolio containers now use event tracing for metrics by default

**Key Features:**
- Container lifecycle-based writing (write when destroyed, not at phase end)
- Configurable event tracing list (e.g., ['POSITION_OPEN', 'POSITION_CLOSE', 'FILL'])
- Smart retention policies (trade_complete, sliding_window, minimal)

### 3. Workflow Updates (`src/core/coordinator_refactor/workflow.py`)

**Modified Methods:**
- `_execute_phase()`: Now passes `results_dir` from config to context for proper result organization

### 4. Train-Test Workflow Update (`src/core/coordinator_refactor/workflows/train_test_optimization.py`)

**Modified Methods:**
- `get_phases()`: Enhanced to support memory management configuration
  - Workflow defines intelligent defaults per phase
  - Supports user overrides at global and phase levels
  - Training phase defaults to disk storage (large optimization)
  - Testing phase defaults to memory with equity tracking

## Configuration Flow

```
User YAML → Workflow → PhaseConfig.config → Sequencer → TopologyBuilder → Containers
```

### User Configuration Example

```yaml
workflow: train_test_optimization
results_dir: my_experiment_2024_01

# Optional overrides
results_storage: memory  # Global override

phase_overrides:
  training:
    results_storage: memory
    event_tracing: ['POSITION_OPEN', 'POSITION_CLOSE', 'FILL', 'PORTFOLIO_UPDATE']
    retention_policy: sliding_window
```

## Results Directory Structure

```
results/
└── my_experiment_2024_01/
    ├── training/
    │   ├── containers/
    │   │   ├── portfolio_001_results.json
    │   │   └── portfolio_002_results.json
    │   ├── aggregate_results.json
    │   └── phase_summary.json
    └── testing/
        └── (similar structure)
```

## Key Benefits Achieved

1. **Container Lifecycle Writing**: Results written when containers destroyed, not at phase completion
   - Handles walk-forward naturally (each window writes separately)
   - Keeps memory bounded regardless of sequence complexity

2. **Unified Metrics System**: Event tracing IS the metrics system
   - No duplicate tracking systems
   - Smart retention policies minimize memory usage

3. **Simple Configuration**: Just two main fields
   - `results_storage`: memory or disk
   - `event_tracing`: list of events to trace

4. **Workflow Intelligence**: Workflows define optimal settings
   - Users only override what they need
   - Sensible defaults for different phase types

## What Still Needs Implementation

1. **EventTracer Disk Writing**: The EventTracer needs streaming disk writer capability
2. **Real Topology Execution**: The `_execute_topology` method in sequencer is currently a mock
3. **Container Lifecycle Integration**: Need to ensure containers properly call cleanup when destroyed
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive tests for memory usage with different retention policies

## Testing

Created `test_memory_management.py` to demonstrate:
- Configuration examples with overrides
- Container lifecycle explanation
- Memory usage estimates
- Expected results structure

## Documentation

Updated `docs/architecture/INTER_PHASE_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.md` with:
- Complete implementation approach
- Configuration examples
- Code snippets showing the implementation
- Clear explanation of phases vs sequences vs execution windows
