# Keltner Strategy Analysis with Full OHLC Data - Realistic Results

## Critical Update: Real Stop Loss Behavior

### Previous Analysis (Sparse Data) vs Reality (Full OHLC)

**Previous findings were dangerously misleading:**
- Sparse data: 1 bps stop showed 6.80 bps/trade with 0 winners stopped
- Reality: 1 bps stop shows 0.45 bps/trade with 98.7% of stops hitting winners!

### Actual Stop Loss Performance

| Stop Loss | RPT (bps) | Win Rate | Stop Rate | Winners Stopped |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| None | 0.45 | 53.0% | 0% | - |
| 1 bps | 0.45 | 18.8% | 80.5% | 98.7% |
| 2 bps | 0.49 | 30.3% | 66.1% | 97.2% |
| 5 bps | 0.51 | 46.3% | 35.9% | 84.1% |
| 10 bps | 0.58 | 51.9% | 13.2% | 59.4% |
| 20 bps | 0.59 | 53.0% | 2.4% | 25.0% |
| 50 bps | 0.45 | 53.0% | 0.3% | 0% |

## Key Findings

### 1. Ultra-Tight Stops Are Counterproductive
- 1-2 bps stops trigger on 66-80% of trades
- They stop out mostly winners (97-99%)
- Net effect: Similar or worse performance than no stops

### 2. Optimal Stop Loss: 10-20 bps
- **10 bps**: 0.58 bps/trade (+29% improvement)
- **20 bps**: 0.59 bps/trade (+31% improvement)
- Reasonable stop rates (2-13%)
- Balanced winner/loser stopping

### 3. The Strategy Has Changed Dramatically
Comparing to previous analysis:
- Previous: 2.70 bps/trade baseline
- Current: 0.45 bps/trade baseline
- This is a 6x difference!

## Possible Explanations for Discrepancy

1. **Different Workspaces/Strategies**
   - We may be analyzing a different strategy variant
   - The "compiled_strategy_4" might not be the same one

2. **Data Alignment Issues**
   - Signal timestamps might not align with OHLC bars
   - Time zone or indexing mismatches

3. **Execution Assumptions**
   - Previous analysis might have different execution cost assumptions
   - Entry/exit price calculations could differ

## Realistic Performance Expectations

### With Optimal 20 bps Stop
- Return per trade: 0.59 bps
- Trade frequency: ~4.6 trades/day (based on previous analysis)
- Daily return: 2.7 bps
- Annual return: ~6.8% (not the 94% previously suggested!)

### Risk Considerations
- 53% win rate is more realistic than 77%
- Stop losses provide modest improvement (31%)
- Very tight stops are harmful due to noise

## Updated Recommendations

### 1. Re-verify Strategy Performance
- Confirm we're analyzing the correct strategy
- Check signal/OHLC alignment
- Validate execution cost assumptions

### 2. Use Moderate Stop Losses
- Implement 10-20 bps stops
- Avoid ultra-tight stops (< 5 bps)
- Monitor actual vs expected stop behavior

### 3. Temper Expectations
- 0.45-0.59 bps/trade is still profitable
- Focus on consistency over home runs
- Consider transaction costs carefully

### 4. Further Investigation Needed
The 6x performance difference between analyses suggests:
- Data quality issues
- Strategy identification problems
- Execution assumption mismatches

## Conclusion

The full OHLC analysis reveals that ultra-tight stops are counterproductive due to market noise. The optimal approach uses 10-20 bps stops for modest improvement. The dramatic performance difference from previous analysis requires immediate investigation before any trading decisions.
